<h2>"1923."</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>[The following is the description by Professor J. Scott, F.R.S.,
of his recent Airship Journey across the old Bed of the
North Sea. July 1, 1923.]</p>
</div>

<p>It is perhaps unnecessary for me to state the
objects and purpose of my journey of last week,
as it would be false modesty in me not to
recognise the great interest taken by the
geologic and antiquarian worlds in my proposed
enterprise. For the benefit, however, of
those for whose intelligence the so-called
"Popular" geologic works are compiled, I will
recapitulate some points which are ancient
history to my instructed readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
    The winter of 1922 witnessed the greatest
geologic change in the earth's surface since the
last of the Glacial epochs. Into the causes and
general results of this change I do not propose
to enter, beyond mentioning my opinion that
the theory propounded by Professor Middleton
(a theory designed only for one purpose&mdash;that
of attempting to throw doubt on the data and
reasoning of my first monograph on the subject)
is not only childish, but based on a fallacy.</p>

<p>I will confine myself to the results as they
affected this country and the continent of
Europe, of which it is now a prolongation or
headland&mdash;not, as the Daily Press erroneously
labels it, a peninsula.</p>

<p>The total change in elevation of the land is
now calculated at 490 feet 7 inches, but more accurate
measurements are still being taken. This
great change brings us back to a geologic age
when man and mammoth co-existed in the
primeval forest of Cromer, and when the Dogger
Bank was a great plain where wild beasts
roamed and palæolithic man left the traces of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
his industry in the bones and shaped flints which
we hope soon to collect in quantities from the
mud and ooze with which thousands of years of
sea-action has covered them.</p>

<p>I had little difficulty in obtaining Admiralty
permission to accompany the Captain of a Naval
Airship on one of his regular patrol trips across
the great expanse of mud which was once the
North Sea.</p>

<p>Of course in the six months since the departure
of the Ocean from the new lands, the
district has been regularly patrolled by the
Navy, but the air is as yet the only safe route
by which to cross it. It will be some time,
perhaps years, before the surface becomes safe
to walk on, although the Government is plentifully
sprinkling grass and other seeds from all
passing aircraft. In the large and powerful
airship in which I was privileged to travel,
we had every modern device for enabling a
close inspection of the surface to be taken. A
trail-rope was used when it was desired to drift
slowly or to actually hover over some of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
points of interest which we observed on our
passage.</p>

<p>The day was fine and clear, and I could not
have wished for better weather conditions when
we rose over Dover and started the main engines
on a north-easterly course. As no maps can
yet be compiled of the New Lands (as popular
clamour has most inaccurately labelled them)
owing to their dangerous surface, we navigated
by the old Admiralty charts, marked in depths
of water, and I was amused at having the
Varne and Goodwin "shoals" pointed out to
me&mdash;the objects indicated being long ridges of
sandy hills rising from the shining surface of
the Channel bed. Off Deal and Dover a few
of the wrecks are being worked on by enterprising
local Salvage Companies&mdash;a road being
laid out to each composed of gravel, sand, and
brushwood. I fear, however, that the speculators
will not profit greatly. The roads are
good enough over the sand, but where they
cross the mud-flats they swallow not only their
traffic but the funds of their owners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
    As we travelled up the valley with the drone
of our engines echoing from the whale-backed
ridges on either side, with our gondolas barely
a hundred feet from the ground, I discussed
our programme with the Captain, whose views
and reminiscences I found most entertaining.
On general subjects he was like most of his
service, almost contemptibly uneducated (I
might mention that he did not understand what
Magdalenian culture was!), but he was evidently
well read in his own trade. He told
me several stories which were no doubt excellent,
but which were marred to a point of
incomprehensibility by a foolish interlarding
of technical terms. I gave him a short précis
of what is known or deduced of prehistoric
life on the New Lands, and spoke of the bones
and fossils occasionally found in trawl-nets
by the fishermen. His point of view was that
the war overshadowed everything. He seemed
to think that that event was one from which
all others should date, although it had lasted
such a short time. As very little of interest
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
to me could yet be seen owing to the general
coating of slime with which the land was
covered, I amused myself by listening to his
experiences on his weekly air patrols, his conversation
being somewhat after this style:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a fair snorter while it lasted&mdash;that
gale,&mdash;damn lucky we hadn't many ships
out. Yes, most of 'em got in. They either
ran down Channel (Lord! the Straits were like
opening the caisson gates to a graving-dock!)
and made New Queenstown, or else they got
into harbour on the East Coast and stranded
there. You see, what with mines and wrecks,
the North Sea wasn't being used much, and as
the navies were taking a rest there wasn't
much of value at sea. Some ships got stuck
though&mdash;fishing boats mostly. No, they were
all right&mdash;it took a week to drain off, and it
was calm weather when they grounded. Most
of them have wireless now, and they yelped
for help, and we took 'em off. Those that
hadn't were a bit hungry when we found them,
but I don't think we lost many. You see, all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
nations sent air fleets out. Have you read
the U.S. Magazine? You ought to; there's
a damn good argument going on as to whether
it would have paid us or Germany most if it
had happened during the war. I think us,
myself. You see, there's only a narrow channel
now running past the Norwegian coast, and
we could have mined that. Look at that, Professor!
How's that for mines? That's Zeebrugge
with the houses showing over the sand-hills.
Whose? Oh! both sides put 'em there&mdash;that
hollow to the east is proper stiff with them,
isn't it? Port fifteen&mdash;Quartermaster! steer
east&mdash;What? No, just going to show you
something. You said it seemed a wicked waste
of material; well, look over there&mdash;two of them
got it. One's a U.C. boat but the other's a
big one. They picked them up coming back,
and that big chap's nearly in two halves&mdash;Starboard
twenty, Quartermaster! No, we
needn't go closer, you'll see one every half mile
between here and Heligoland&mdash;some of ours as
well as theirs. Yes&mdash;that's a Dutchman&mdash;torpedoed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
by the look of him. See the hole in
the stern? Oh, butter and bacon and that
sort of thing! No, nobody in her. Why?
Well, look at the davits&mdash;they left her before
she sank&mdash;all the boats are gone.</p>

<p>"Like these glasses? That's the <i>Hinder</i> over
there. Yes, they still live in her, and she's
still useful. A fine big lightship, isn't she?
She settled down at her moorings as peacefully
as could be, and when we sent a line down to
them on our first patrol trip after the show,
they sent up a note asking for some 'baccy,
and would we post some letters for them?
Nothing ever did worry the <i>Hinder</i> in the war,
and it won't now. You see, English and German
used to fight under her tail every other night,
and as she was an international light she just
flashed away and looked on. I wonder none
of their crew have written a book yet&mdash;'Battles
round the <i>Hinder</i>,' by an Eyewitness. It would
be better than most of the truck that has been
written in England about it. Yes, she lies in
a bit of a hollow, but the light shows up all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
right, and that's all we want. Here you are;
this is what you wanted."</p>

<p>We had reached the first object of interest
in my journey. More trail-rope was paid out,
and we swung with our engine stopped, downwind,
lying twenty feet above a great pit torn
in the earth by some tremendous explosion.
All around the pit-mouth lay masses of earth
and rock, and the face of the crater was thick
with bone-breccia and fossils of every kind.
The explosion had occurred over an old beach
on the bank of what had once been the old
Channel River. For thousands of years prehistoric
men and beasts had lived and died
there, and had left their skeletons to enlighten
us. And more than bones had been left.
Almost the first basket-load that our light
electric "grab" produced for us contained
among its numerous specimens of surpassing
interest a rough "hand-axe" of dark flint,
possibly of Pre-Chellean culture. However,
the whole of my notes and specimens obtained
on this visit are now being examined and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
classified, and I will postpone description of
them until the meeting of the Society on
the 18th.</p>

<p>I would have liked to have descended into
the pit by a ladder or other means, but was
dissuaded, partly by the motion of the airship,
which swayed to and fro in the light wind,
and partly by the blunt negative with which
my suggestion was greeted by the Captain.
We took only three baskets of specimens from
this spot, as we had others to visit, and our
carrying capacity was limited. As we slowly
hauled in the trail-rope and prepared to continue
our journey, I asked the Captain whether
this crater had been intentionally formed by
the Government for purposes of research, or
whether it had been produced accidentally in
the late war.</p>

<p>"Accident?" he said. "Well, no, hardly that&mdash;but
still, I expect he <i>thought</i> he might pull
it off without doing himself in." He pointed
to one of two big submarines which lay on
opposite sides of the crater. The one indicated
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
was the smaller of the two, and the least
damaged. She lay upright with a slight tilt
up by the bow (which was dented and torn
rather badly). The other was in two halves,
and lay on her side with a mound of earth,
bones, and rock, making a sort of rough junction
between the halves. The two submarines looked
like great guardians of the pit, and I wondered
at the madness of man that makes him revel
in war and killing to no purpose. I mentioned
something of this thought to the Captain, who
was still gazing at the more intact of the two
boats, and tapping a flint "Coup de poing" on
the side of our gondola.</p>

<p>"Well, Professor," he said, "the man who
made this tool didn't make it to clean his nails
with, did he?" I observed that it was now
generally agreed that most of prehistoric man's
weapons were for use against his greatest foes&mdash;which
were wild beasts, and not men. The
Captain jerked the flint implement back into
the basket.</p>

<p>"My oath! you've said it," he snapped.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
"<i>We've</i> been fighting wild beasts, and that
chap in the smaller boat was a friend of
mine. He took that Fritz fairly amidships
with his stem, but he couldn't get free, and
they went down locked. When Fritz hit
bottom his mines went, and that blew them
apart, and so there's your bone pit, Professor."</p>

<p>I looked back at the pit and the two hulks
beside it, now dwindling astern. "How do
you know all that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Read his number on the conning-tower for
one thing, and the chap who had that boat
would be pretty sure to take a Hun with him
when he had to go. The rest? Well, his
bows are bashed in, you see, and his lid is still
open, so he gave Fritz his bow first on the
surface. You may have some relics of curious
beasts in that basket, Professor, but I can show
you a relic, or a hundred if you like, of a damn
sight nastier beast. See the masts over that
mudbank? That's a Dutch liner&mdash;two torpedoes
and no warning. Full of women too.
Like to go and look? I thought not. Yes,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Professor, I can show you two hundred sunken
ships in a few hours' run here, and they haven't
all got their davits empty by a long chalk.
Never mind&mdash;here's something more amusing."</p>

<p>Our engine slowed and almost stopped while
we drifted across a flat, broad, muddy plateau
which sloped away to a valley on each side.</p>

<p>"See those lines?" said my abrupt naval
friend&mdash;"those long straight scores along the
mud, I mean. Those are where the submarines&mdash;ours
and theirs&mdash;have been taking bottom
for a rest. Taking bottom? Oh! on winter
nights, when it's too dark to see or when
they're waiting for anything, or got defects or
struck fog, you know. They used to take
bottom a lot here, because it's good surface and
they had twenty fathom of water, too. The
marks haven't washed out yet. See this one?
He bumped three times before he settled: he
must have had a lot of headway on&mdash;his track's
all of half a mile. That bed is where he
settled for the night. It's soft there, and he
worked in over his bilge keel. There's another,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
fifty yards off him. Of course it was probably
made a year before or after he made his, but
there must have been cases when our boats and
Fritz's lay that much apart all night and didn't
know it. Pretty queer idea, isn't it? Perhaps
a banjo strumming in one boat and a gramophone
going in the other. Oh yes, they used
to have concerts on the bottom before turning
in! One of our chaps gave me a programme
once. There were twenty items in it, and it
was headed 'C/o G.P.O.&mdash;126 feet.' This was
a regular submarine traffic lane for both sides.
Some parts of the surface up north aren't
marked at all,&mdash;it was either too deep water
or there were too many mines about. Funny
thing is, that some of the areas which both
sides seem to have studiously gone round and
avoided have no mines at all in them. Just
rumour, I suppose. They gave the place a
bad name and damned it. Eh? No&mdash;that's
all right&mdash;tip 'em out on the deck&mdash;we can
scrub the place out when we get in."</p>

<p>He spoke to a sailor, who stepped forward
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and turned the nearest basket of specimens
upside down. As he did so, something rolled
from the heap to my feet, and with a thrill
which could only be understood by my brother
scientists I gazed on the greatest archæological
discovery of the ages. I have already announced
my discovery to the press, and the
scientists of all nations are now gathering in
London to inspect it, so I shall not enter now
on a detailed description. I may say that my
first thought was that I had in my hands a
copy of my confrère Keith's reconstruction of
the Piltdown skull, and that my own reconstruction
had been to a certain extent false;
but on mature reflection I decided that this
could not be so, and that I must classify my
find as belonging to a hitherto unknown branch
of the race of Homo Sapiens&mdash;akin to, but yet
distinct from, Eoanthropus. This prehistoric
man I have called Homo Scoticanthropus, and
my full report and conclusions will be shortly
before the Society.</p>

<p>The skull is intact and requires no reconstruction.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
The lower mandible is of the chimpanzee-like
type found with Eoanthropus, and
as it was picked up by the same basket, must
undoubtedly belong to the skull.</p>

<p>As to the remainder of our voyage, I can
only say that I spent the time on the floor of
the gondola measuring and inspecting my find.
I could not tear myself away from it, and we
therefore omitted our visits to other spots
where explosions were known to have occurred
near the old sea-bed, confining ourselves to a
hurried round of the Naval patrol route. Beyond
a casual inspection and a remark that it
looked like Hindenburg, the airship captain
took no interest in this now famous skull, but
confined himself to his duties of navigation and
control.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the exact depth and
geological strata of the skull's position cannot
be given. The basket was drawn from the
bottom of the pit, but the skull may have been
either thrown up by the explosion or rolled
down later by the action of the tides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
    When the new lands have dried we hope to
have a careful inspection of that and other
pits, when more and perhaps equally valuable
discoveries may be made.</p>

<p>I have perhaps made undue mention of my
naval friend in this pamphlet, but to tell the
truth his type was new to me. Though, like
all his fellow-officers, his limited education had
tended to make him narrow-minded, he nevertheless
deserves mention here as having assisted,
albeit in a humble way, in the most wonderful
discovery in history.</p>

<h2>ACCORDING TO THEIR LIGHTS.</h2>

<p>The world was a streak of green and white
bubbles, and there was a great roaring noise
which disturbed his thoughts. "Boots&mdash;boots&mdash;I
must get them off." He remembered the only
occasion on which he had experienced an anæsthetic,
the mental struggle to retain his ego, and
the loss of will-power he had known at every
breath. He was going down now, the roaring
was less terrible and he felt very tired. A
check in his descent and a little voice at the
back of his brain: "There was a big sea
running." Then a blur of white foam and a
long gasping breath. Something rasped his
forehead and a rough serge sleeve was across
his throat. He fought feebly to keep the choking
arm away, but as they rose on the crest of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
a long blue-green swell, he was jerked from the
water by the neck and the belt of his overcoat.
His first clear sensation was one of intense chill.
Although there was little wind, it was cold
in the air. He raised his head and moved to
avoid the uncomfortable pressure of something
on his chest. As he saw his situation he dropped
his head again quickly and lay still. He was
across the keel of a broad grey boat which
pitched and heaved at terrifying angles as the
seas passed. He crawled cautiously round, pivoting
on his stomach till his legs straddled the
keel and he had a grip on it with his hands
under his chin. Facing him in a similar attitude
was a seaman he knew, a tall brawny torpedoman
whom he had noticed rigging the lights
in the Wardroom flat on occasions when Evening
Service had been held there. What was his
name&mdash;Davies? Denny? No, Dunn! of course&mdash;the
ship's boxer, and the funny man at the
concerts. Were they two all that was left?
He opened his mouth and gasped a little before
speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
    "All right, sir&mdash;take it easy&mdash;I've been off
this billet twice, and it's no joke getting back
to it. Good thing you're a light weight, sir,
or you'd've pulled me in just now."</p>

<p>"Are there&mdash;are there any more, Dunn?"</p>

<p>"God knows, sir&mdash;beggin' your pardon, that
is&mdash;the mine got us forr'd and the magazine
went. This is the pinnace we're on, and it's the
biggest bit of the ship I've seen floating yet."</p>

<p>"Good God! Where were you?"</p>

<p>"On the bridge, sir, just sent for by the
Officer of the Watch about the telephones; but
I'm&mdash;I don't know 'ow I got away, sir&mdash;flew,
I reckon. Where were you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Coming up the Wardroom ladder, and as I
got on deck I was washed away. Dunn! do
you think we'll be picked up?"</p>

<p>The seaman raised his head and shoulders
cautiously and took a rapid glance around as
they topped a sea, then resumed his attitude
along the keel, his chin on his crossed wrists.
"You're a parson, sir," he said, "and you're
ready for it, so I'll tell you. We were on detached
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
duty, and there mayn't be another ship
here for a week yet."</p>

<p>"A week! But, man, a merchant ship or
fisherman might pass any time."</p>

<p>"A fisherman might, sir; but I never saw a
merchantman since we came on this trip, and
I don't see anything now."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and the padre shivered
in his thin wet clothes. "The sea was going
down this morning; how long do you think we
could stay alive on this?"</p>

<p>"That's the trouble, sir. This is the pinnace,
and she's stove in a bit."</p>

<p>"Do you mean she'll sink? But they float
when they are waterlogged, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Not this one, she won't, and she's got the
launch's slings in her too&mdash;half an hour I give
her; but you're right, sir; the sea's going down,
and I'm keeping a watch out for more wreckage
if it goes by, sir."</p>

<p>The shivering-fit passed and he tried to collect
his thoughts. Yes, the pinnace <i>had</i> settled a
bit since he had been dragged aboard. She did
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
not lift so easily to the sea, and had lost the
tendency to broach-to which had made him grip
the keel so tightly at first. He was quite calm
now, and everything seemed much more simple.
Half an hour! He lowered his forehead to his
hands and his thoughts raced. What had he left
undone? Yes, the ship was gone, so he had
nothing to think of in connection with her. As
Dunn would say, his affairs in her were all
"clewed up" by her loss. But ashore, now&mdash;ah!
For a full minute he fought with his panic. He
felt a rage against a fate that was blindly killing
him when he had so much more of life to enjoy.
He wanted to scream like a trapped rabbit. He
felt his eyes wet with tears of self-pity, and at
the feeling his sense of humour returned. He
thought of himself as a child about to be
smacked, and when he raised his head he was
smiling into Dunn's eyes. "Half an hour is
not long, Dunn," he said, "but it is longer
than our friends had."</p>

<p>Dunn took another swift glance to right and
left, then, reaching a hand cautiously into his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
jumper, pulled out a wet and shiny briar pipe,
and began to reflectively chew the mouthpiece.</p>

<p>He was a young <i>padre</i>, but he had been in
the Service most of the war. He knew enough
to choose his words with care as he spoke again.</p>

<p>"Dunn," he said, "we haven't got long. I am
going to pray."</p>

<p>"Yessir," said the bony, red face before him.</p>

<p>He tried again. "Dunn, you're Church of
England, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yessir. On the books I am, sir."</p>

<p>"You mean you have no religion?"</p>

<p>Dunn blew hard into the bowl of his pipe and
replaced the mouthpiece between his jagged
teeth. "Not that sort quite, sir&mdash;but I'm all
right, sir."</p>

<p>The <i>padre</i> moved a little bit nearer along the
keel. The pinnace was certainly deep in the
water now, but his mind was at ease and he did
not feel the cold. "Listen, Dunn," he said; "I
am going to pray&mdash;I want you to repeat what
I say after me."</p>

<p>Dunn moved his hands from under his chin
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and took his pipe from his mouth. "Yessir,"
he said.</p>

<p>The <i>padre</i> paused a moment and looked at
the long blue slope of a sea rising above his
eyes. He wondered vaguely why he was not
feeling sea-sick. "O God, Who made the sea
and all that therein is, have mercy on us Thy
servants called to-day to Thy judgment-seat.
Pardon us the manifold sins we have committed,
and lead us to a true repentance; and to us, who
have in the past neglected Thee in our hearts,
send light and strength that we may come
without fear before Thy throne. Have pity,
O Lord, upon those who are made widows and
orphans this day. Grant to our country final
victory and Thy peace. Amen."</p>

<p>The sun was behind clouds now, and the seas
were washing occasionally along the sinking
boat.</p>

<p>"You did not join me in the prayer, Dunn,"
he said. "Was it not within the scheme of your
religion?"</p>

<p>Dunn put his pipe carefully back in his jumper
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and took a firmer grip of the keel. "Yes, sir," he
said, "it was&mdash;but I don't whine when I'm down."</p>

<p>"Do you mean I was whining, Dunn?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I don't. You've always prayed and
you're not going back on anything. I don't go
much on Church, and God wouldn't think nothing
of me if I piped down now."</p>

<p>The <i>padre</i> was, as has been said, a young man,
and being young he did the right thing and
waited for more. It came with a rush.</p>

<p>"You see, sir, it's God this, and God that, and
no one knows what God is like, but I'm a Navy
man and I think of Him my way. If I'm not
afraid to die I'm all right, I think, sir. It wasn't
my fault the ship sank, sir. I've always kept
my job done, and I've got 'Exceptional' on my
parchment. When I joined up I took the chance
of this, and I ain't kicking now it's come. I
reckon if a man plays the game by his messmates,
and fights clean in the ring, and takes
a pride, like, in his job&mdash;well, it ain't for me to
say, but I don't think God'll do much to me.
He'll say, 'Jack,' He'll say, 'you've got a lot of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
things against you here, but you ain't shirked
your work and you aren't afraid of Me&mdash;so pass
in with a caution,' He'll say. You're all right,
sir, and it may be because you're a good Christian;
but I reckon, sir, it's because you know you've
done your job and not skrimshanked it that you
ain't afraid, just the same as me.... Hold
tight, sir,&mdash;she'll not be long now."</p>

<p>The <i>padre</i> ducked his head as a swell passed,
but the sea had no crest now, the weather was
certainly improving. "I don't say you're right,"
he said, "but I haven't time to bring you to my
way of thinking now."</p>

<p>The pinnace began to stand on end with a
gurgling and bubbling of air from her bow. The
two men slipped off on opposite sides, still holding
the rough splintery keel between them.</p>

<p>"Listen, Dunn&mdash;repeat this after me: 'Please
God, I have done my best, and I'm not afraid
to come to You.'"</p>

<p>"'Please God, I've done my best, and I'm not
afraid to come to You,' sir. Good-bye, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Dunn&mdash;good-bye."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
    The sunset lit up the slope of a sea that looked
majestically down on them, and flashed on
something behind it. As they looked the wet
grey conning-tower of a submarine showed
barely fifty yards away. The startled sea
pounded at her hull as she rose and grew, and
a rush of spray shook out the folds of a limp
and draggled White Ensign that hung from
the after-stanchion of her bridge.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<h2>A NAVAL DISCUSSION.</h2>

<p>The air was thick with smoke, and a half-circle
of officers sat clustered round the stove in the
smoking-room. True&mdash;there was no fire in the
stove, but that did not count. A stove was a
place you sat around and jerked cigarette ash
at, or, if you were long enough, rested your
heels on. The party consisted of six ship's
officers and a guest. A few feet away a
Bridge-party was in progress. It was the usual
Naval party, and was composed of one man
who could play, two who thought they could,
and one who had come in in response to urgent
demands to "make up a four," and who held no
illusions about his own play or his partner's.
However, he argued well, which was a help.
The game appeared to go in spasms&mdash;a few
minutes' peace punctuated only by subdued
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
oaths, and then a cross-fire of abuse and recriminations&mdash;usually
opened by the fourth player,
who had somewhere learnt the wonderful feminine
art of getting in first accusation, and then
dodging his opponents' salvoes behind a smoke-screen
of side-issues.</p>

<p>The group by the stove were not in the
least disturbed by the game behind them.
They had heard Naval Bridge played before,
and knew that it was only when the players
became polite that trouble was in the offing.
The talk, as always, was of the War, and
swung with startling suddenness from one queer
aspect to another. The Senior Engineer was
leaning back in his chair, his pipe between his
teeth, listening to the mixture of views and
voices from either side of him.</p>

<p>"What do they want this saluting order at
all for? They're making everybody salute
everybody in London now, and they say it
isn't safe to walk down the Haymarket to the
Admiralty, because the traffic stands to attention
for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
    "All damn nonsense. There's too much
saluting&mdash;that sort, I mean&mdash;and there's too
little of the other sort. Let's have an order
that every civilian must salute a wounded man,
or a man with a wound stripe, and then I'll
take Provost-Marshal and see it done."</p>

<p>"They'd chuck their hands in. They're all
talking of Democracy now, and a wounded man
would count as a gilded autocrat."</p>

<p>"Democracy, my foot! I know their sort of
Democracy. It's like Russia's special brand&mdash;do
as you please, and make all you can for
yourself. A civilian's no good till he's a conscript
or done his time in the Territorials. If
they want democracy they can come here. This
is the most democratic Service in the world."</p>

<p>"But you can't run down civilians over this
war; why&mdash;the whole Army's civilian now.
They haven't done so badly, though they had to
wait for war before they moved."</p>

<p>"Whose fault was it they didn't help before?
It wasn't ours. But that's just what I'm
saying. They're all right once they've been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
drilled, but no damn good till they have been.
We ought to put the whole lot through a short
course of drill and a week of trench work, and
let them go again."</p>

<p>The guest's voice broke in&mdash;"You mean, I
take it, that the people who are going to make
the peace are the people who have not yet
learnt discipline?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;that's about it. They haven't
learnt to think for their side instead of their
own private ends."</p>

<p>"Call 'em politicians and have done with it,
Pongo!"</p>

<p>"Well, they are&mdash;aren't they? They get the
politicians they like, and they appoint men of
their own sort, so they are all politicians
really."</p>

<p>"Well, I think that's being rather hard on
them. They have to take the men the party
whips gave them. I think they're a poor lot,
but I wouldn't call them politicians."</p>

<p>The guest moved uneasily. "I don't quite see
your point," he said. "Is the term 'politician'
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
one of reproach or praise? I once stood for my
local constituency and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young officer with his heels on the stove
gave a sudden snort. "Don't you believe him,
he's pulling your legs&mdash;so don't apologise. He's
no politician, anyway."</p>

<p>The guest laughed. "Well, I'm not in politics
now," he said. "What is your definition of this
strange animal?"</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then a cautious reply,
"Well, he's an M.P."</p>

<p>"But I know some very charming M.P.'s&mdash;are
they all politicians?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir. They're different. It's a question
of standards, really."</p>

<p>"Ah, but what are the standards?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see&mdash;we have one&mdash;and civilians
have another, business people and so on, and
then there's the politicians."</p>

<p>"You ought to write a dictionary, Pongo&mdash;you
snub-nosed old shell-back. No, I ain't
scrapping, and if you get up I'll take your
chair."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
    "Whose got a cigarette? No, not one of
your stinkers&mdash;gimme one of yours, Guns."</p>

<p>The officer addressed politely passed a cigarette
across in his fingers, and turning in his chair
beckoned to a marine servant who was just returning
with an empty tray from the Bridge table.</p>

<p>"A cigarette, please, waiter&mdash;and debit it to
the account of my honourable friend Mr Maugham,
here. I'll stop your cadging, Pongo&mdash;if I
have to take on the tobacco accounts to do it."</p>

<p>"Lucky there's no shortage of 'baccy, or all
the armies would strike."</p>

<p>"Well, that'd be one way to stop the war.
You can't fight without it. Wish we had some
tobacco shares. Some people must be making
a lot."</p>

<p>"Not so much as the food people."</p>

<p>"I don't believe the food people do make so
much. It's the world shortage that causes the
trouble, not the prices&mdash;or rather one involves
the other."</p>

<p>"It isn't so much that. It's a rise of prices
all round. Things get expensive, so the country
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
strikes for higher wages and gets them&mdash;then
prices go up because the sovereign has depreciated,
and they strike again. It goes on in a
vicious circle."</p>

<p>"Can't be a circle&mdash;because that's progression.
You've got to get to a smash in time."</p>

<p>"Yes, it means there'll be just as much cash
in the world, but every one will be poor. Cash
isn't wealth&mdash;work is wealth, and all work
nowadays is wasted. We're chucking it into
the air in Flanders."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll last out this war, and then have
to lash out."</p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;there'll be room to lash out in, too.
We'll be back in Elizabeth's days&mdash;lots of room
for every one, but no capital."</p>

<p>"So long as there are no Huns we'll be happy,
so what's the odds? Give us a match."</p>

<p>"Well, I want a few Huns left to compare
notes with after this. It would be dull to hear
our own side only. One couldn't meet their
Army, of course, but their Navy's not so bad.
They've tried to fight clean, at any rate, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
they fight good and 'earty. Yes, I know about
Fritz, but if you had orders to torpedo liners,
wouldn't you do it? 'Course you would, if you
were told they were carrying munitions and
you were saving your country by it. There are
Fritzes who <i>like</i> it, certainly, but we have to
give the others the benefit of the doubt."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to read their logs and so on
after the war, though we'll be so damn sick of
all the truck they'll publish here when the
Censor pays off that we wont want to read
much of anything."</p>

<p>"It isn't the stuff just after the war one
would like to read. I'd like to be alive in a
hundred years to read the truth."</p>

<p>"Well, you wont be if you knock my drink
over with your hairy hoofs&mdash;sit still!"</p>

<p>"It'd do you good if I did knock it over&mdash;your
hoary-headed old rip. Guns, do you think
they'll have raised our pay in a hundred years'
time?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it. They'll pay off the Navy and
economise as soon as peace is signed&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
    "&mdash;And we'll have another war on our hands
inside six months&mdash;we always do; we've always
retrenched after a war, and then had to give
bonuses to get the men back inside a year."</p>

<p>"Well, they'll pay off the battleships, anyway&mdash;and
only keep the fast cruisers and the
submarines."</p>

<p>"You and your submarines! Have you heard
from your brother lately?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he tells me if I'm going to join I've got
to remember it's the greatest honour to be&mdash;half
a sec., I've got the letter here&mdash;to be alive
and able to get into the greatest and most
efficient Service of the Greatest Navy the world
has ever seen, in the Greatest event in History
since the Moon broke off."</p>

<p>There was a two seconds' silence (which is
long for a Naval discussion), then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, cutting out the swollen-headed tosh
about the Greatest Service, which I take it he
means to refer to submarines, I don't know that
he's far wrong."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose we shall have our pasts and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
presents all looked up, and that people at the
U.S. Institution will argue about us like they
did a few years ago about Trafalgar."</p>

<p>"No fear. They'll all be peaceful then, and
we'll be barbarians, and not to be spoken of."</p>

<p>"Barbarian, my foot! We're the cleanest lot
in England, and the English are cleaner than
most races."</p>

<p>"Do you think there'll be another battle?"</p>

<p>"Oh, help! If that cag's going to start, I'm
off. Good-night, sir."</p>

<p>"I must go too, Jim," said the guest, with
a startled glance at the clock. "Where did I
leave my coat?"</p>

<p>The Senior Engineer rose and followed them
out, hearing as he passed through the door an
unwearying voice by the stove&mdash;"I know a
chap on Beatty's staff, and he says they'll fight
next spring or summer."</p>

<h2>THE GUNLAYER.</h2>

<p>"<i>Hit first&mdash;hit hard&mdash;and keep on hitting</i>, is
a good rule, but what I want to impress on you
is that in this war the last part of that rule is
the most important. The enemy shoots remarkably
well&mdash;at a target&mdash;but he does not appear
to stand punishment well himself. It is remarkable
how the German shooting falls off once he
gets a few big shells aboard him, and up to
date it has been noticeable that our own
practice is, up to a certain point, improved
by our being hit. It is just a matter of sticking
power...."</p>

<p>The Gunnery Lieutenant paused in his lecture
and sighed. "Would these pasty-faced beggars
stick it?" He had had a week to train the crew&mdash;most
of them raw hands&mdash;of the latest and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
fastest light cruiser, into a semblance of war
efficiency, and the effort was tiring him. They
were so very new and unintelligent, and he had
had to go over the A B C of gunnery with them
as if they had never been through their course
before joining. Seven bells struck, and he
dismissed the class and sent them shuffling and
elbowing out of the flat.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>They had been stationed at the guns three
hours and had seen nothing. This was their
second day out, and the first nervousness and
feeling of shyness at being in enemy waters
was wearing off. The mist that had been with
them since dawn was clearing away too, and
the gunlayer of No. Five straightened his back
and stretched himself against the shield. This
was a silly game, he decided. Two cables astern
the knife-edge stem of a sister ship was parting
their wake into two creamy undulating waves
which seemed to spoil the mirror-like surface of
what the German wireless has with inimitable
humour termed "The fringe of the English barred
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
zone," or as their Lordships more drily put it,
"The mouth of the Bight."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The gunlayer spat carefully over the side
and felt in his cap-rim for a cigarette. He
calculated that he would make the "fag," with
care, last till breakfast. Fourteen days in
commission had at any rate taught him that
the art of shortening up the frequent spells of
boredom consisted in a judicious mixture of
tobacco and thinking, and as smoking was
barred under heavy penalties during the dark
hours, his brain had been somewhat overworked
since four. As he fumbled for his matches he
froze suddenly still as a bugle blared "Action
stations!" from the bridge above him. He
heard the beginnings of the clatter of men
closing up and the hum of activity along the
deck, but till the cold shiver had passed from
him he could not move. His one idea was that
this was <i>real</i>, and he would give anything to
be out of it. Then in a flash he was at his
sights, his hands on the focussing-ring and his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
head close up to the telescope, in fear that
others might see something in his face that he
did not want them to see. For exactly the
same reasons some hundred other men on the
upper deck were becoming feverishly busy, but
before the last note of the bugle had died the
guns' crews were over their stage fright, and
were, with perhaps a little more care and
intelligence than they had shown at drill, closing
up to their guns.</p>

<p>The gunlayer of No. Five stepped to one side
and looked out on the beam. The mists had
cleared, and far to the east he could see a line
of little smoke puffs that could only mean one
thing&mdash;ships in station and burning high-speed
fuel. The cruiser heeled a little, and the smoke
dots swung from abeam to nearly ahead as
she turned, and he lost sight of them behind
the shield of the next gun. He wanted to go
forward and watch them. It seemed worse to
have it hanging over him like this. He did
not know if he would be quite ready if the
ship turned suddenly to bring his gun to bear
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and he should see the enemy at close range,
and no longer as little brown smoke blurs.</p>

<p>The sight-setter, a boy of seventeen, spoke
to him and he looked round. The boy's face
was rather white, and his lips trembled a little.
The gunlayer woke up at the sight, and broke
into a pleased grin.</p>

<p>"Only little beggars," he said, "hardly enough
to make a mouthful. Don't you make no
blinkin' errors this morning, my lad, or I'll
land you one you'll be proud of!"</p>

<p>The speech cheered him up, and he began to
believe he <i>might</i> come out of it alive&mdash;with
luck. The ship was travelling now. The white
water raced past at a dizzy speed, and a great
sloping V of bubbling foam followed them fifty
yards astern. Every few seconds a quivering
vibration started from forward and travelled
through the hull&mdash;reminding him of a terrier
waiting at a rat-hole. He wanted to smoke&mdash;there
would be just time for a cigarette&mdash;but
although he was afraid of death, he was afraid
of the Gunnery Lieutenant more. He snuggled
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
down to the shoulder-piece and began working
his elevating wheel slowly. There was little
roll on the ship, and he realised thankfully
that there was going to be no difficulty about
keeping his sights on. The oblong port in
the shield through which his telescope passed
worried him: it seemed so unnecessarily big.
That was just like the Admiralty designers, he
thought&mdash;so long as they didn't have to stand
behind the hole they didn't care how big it
was. Why, it would let a six-inch shell
through! He felt quite a grievance about it.
Then, with a heel and an increase of vibration
the ship turned. Lord! there they were&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five
of them&mdash;going like
smoke, too. He pressed close to his telescope,
and the enemy sprang into view&mdash;many times
magnified. The boy sight-setter in a cracked
voice repeated an order, and he heard the quick
shuffle of feet and the word "Ready" come like
a whip-crack from behind him. The leading
enemy danced in the heat-haze as his telescope
swayed up and down her foremast. It all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
depended on him and a few others now. The
responsibility worried him. The gun's crew
behind him were invisible, but he felt that
their eyes were glued to his back, and that
they were wondering if he was going to make
good.</p>

<p>Boom&mdash;Br-r-room&mdash;Boom! That was the
next ahead. It sounded a rotten salvo. Was
she ranging&mdash;or would they all start now? He
saw no splashes by the ship in his sights. Was
it a complete miss, or was it fired at another
enemy?</p>

<p>Boom&mdash;B-r-<i>room</i>! That was a better one.
Weren't <i>they</i> going to do anything? As he
wondered, the enemy cruiser flashed like a red
helio, and he gasped in admiration at the simultaneous
firing of her battery. A great sheet
of white shut out the view in his telescope, and
a deafening crack announced the bursting of
a short salvo. <i>Wow</i>-ooo! Something whined
overhead, and his own gun spoke&mdash;rocking the
shield, and making him flinch from the sights.
<i>Gawd!</i> had he fired with the sights on, or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
were his eyes shut? Anyhow, the men behind
him did not seem to notice anything wrong.
The breech slammed viciously, and the word
"Ready" came on the instant. "<i>Clang</i>"&mdash;something
hit the shield and glanced upwards
as his gun spoke again. He knew he hadn't
had the sights on then&mdash;he hadn't been ready,&mdash;how
the hell could a man keep the sights
on with this going on? Behind him a man
began a scream, a scream which was cut
short suddenly with the crack of a bursting
H.E. shell and the whistle and wail of splinters.
Gawd! this was chronic&mdash;the ship must be
getting it thick. The enemy swung into his
telescope field again, and he saw the throbbing
flame jerk out and vanish from her upper deck.</p>

<p>B-r-r-<i>oom</i>! That was a better salvo. He
must have been on the spot that time&mdash;another
one&mdash;no, he was aiming high then. Still, it
didn't matter. They'd all be dead soon and
nobody would know who'd fired well or badly.
Right abreast the enemy's bridge a great spout
of water shot up, and behind it he saw the yellow
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
sheet of flame that told of half a broadside going
home. "He <i>must</i> keep his sights on"&mdash;"<i>Must</i>
keep his sights on." His gun rocked as it fired,
and he swore under his breath at the delay before
the crew reloaded. Were they all wounded?
They might be&mdash;as he estimated at least three
full salvoes had been aboard since the first shot.
The enemy swung out of his field of view again,
and he took his eye from the telescope a moment.
What the hell was the ship turning for? The
flagship must be crazy&mdash;just when we were
hitting, too. He froze to his eye-piece again,
and saw the familiar bridge and curved stem
of his target as before. A haze of purplish-grey
smoke was over her forecastle, and as he
fired again he saw the flash of another salvo
along her side. What was it "Guns" had said?
<i>The one that sticks it out.</i> Why couldn't they
load quicker behind him? They seemed so slow.
The target vanished suddenly in a pall of brown
smoke, and he lost her for a moment, his sights
swinging down with the gentle motion of the
ship. He saw splashes rise from the sea, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
heard no whine and hum of splinters following.
There she was again! And there was another
salvo in the same place. A voice from behind
him said something, and he barked a profane
response,&mdash;a demand for quicker loading. The
voice replied with, "Stick it, Jerry&mdash;you're
givin' 'er bloody 'ell!" And he realised suddenly
that the hitting now seemed to be all one way,
and that his target was on fire from the bow
to the forward funnel. His sights swung off
again, and a moment later his gun brought up
against the forward stops with a bump. He
raised his head and looked round. Their next
astern was on the quarter now, and they must
have all turned together towards the enemy.
The bow gun still banged away, sending blasts
of hot air back along the deck, but no reply
seemed to be coming. The gunlayer scrambled
up on the shield and looked ahead to the east.
A blur of smoke hid the enemy&mdash;a great brown
greasy cloud&mdash;and he dropped on his knee to the
heel that announced another change of helm.
Round they came&mdash;sixteen points&mdash;and he had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
a view of the Flagship, with a long signal hoist
at her masthead, tearing past in her own wake.</p>

<p>"What the hell&mdash;ain't we going to finish it?
What's the game?" a chorus of voices spoke
from the deck below him, and then came the
"still" of a bugle and the pipe, "Sponge out
and clean guns&mdash;clear up upper deck. Enemy
is under the guns of Heligoland."</p>

<p>"Well, who cares for Heligoland?" said the
gunlayer&mdash;and on the words he came down from
his perch on the gunshield with a run. A roar
like a twelve-inch salvo and a huge column
of tumbling water a hundred yards on the beam
had answered him. The next shell pitched in
their wake&mdash;then another well astern, and they
were out of range. He suddenly realised that
he was thirstier than he had ever been before,
and started forward to the water-tank. As he
moved, a hand clutched his arm and he found
the boy sight-setter at his side, a fountain of
words, dancing with excitement.</p>

<p>"My Christ! that was fine. <i>Gawd</i>&mdash;what a
show, hey? An' you that cool, too. I didn't
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
'alf shake, till I looked at you, an' saw you was
laughin'. We didn't 'alf brown 'em off, did we?
an' they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, go chase yerself," said the gunlayer.
"That weren't nothing. Wait till you sees a
battle, my son&mdash;and you won't think nothing
o' to-day."</p>

<p>As he turned to lift the drinking-cup he
glanced at the clock and saw with amazement
that it was seven-fifteen. With a vague memory
of having done so before, he fumbled in his
cap-lining for a cigarette.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<h2>A WAGE SLAVE.</h2>

<p>The Coxswain nodded to the boy messenger and
reached for his cap.</p>

<p>"All right, my lad&mdash;'ook me down that
lammy. What's the panic, d'ye know?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>I</i> dunno. Sez 'e, 'Tell 'im to come up.
I want 'im at the wheel,' 'e sez. An' I come
along an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;'ook it, and don't stand there
blowin' down my neck."</p>

<p>The Coxswain jerked his "lammy" coat on,
and clumped heavily out of the mess, chewing
a section of ship's biscuit (carefully and cunningly&mdash;for
the shortage of teeth among torpedo
coxswains amounts almost to a badge of
office) as he went.</p>

<p>"What's up, Jim&mdash;steam tattics?" asked the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Torpedo Gunner's Mate&mdash;another Lower Deck
Olympian&mdash;looking up from a three-day-old
'Telegraph.'</p>

<p>The Coxswain grunted in response. It is
not the custom of the Service to answer silly
questions. The reason the question was asked
at all may be put down to the fact of the
'Telegraph' being not only old but empty of
interest.</p>

<p>As he reached the upper deck he buttoned
his coat and felt in his pockets for his mittens.
It was very cold&mdash;a cold accentuated by the
wind of the Destroyer's passage. There was
no sea, but it was pitch-dark, with a glint of
phosphorus from water broken by the wakes
of six "war-built" T.B.D.'s running in line
ahead at an easy twenty-four knots. The Coxswain
could never, in all probability, have
explained his reasoning, though the fact that
the speed had been increased was noticeable;
but he knew, as he swung up the ladders to
the unseen fore-bridge, that he had not been
sent for a mere alteration of course. His brain
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
must have received some telepathic wave from
the ship's hull which told him that the enemy
had had something to do with the break in
his watch below.</p>

<p>His sea-boots ceased their noisy clumping
as he reached the bridge, and he was standing
by the helmsman with a hand on the wheel
before the man had noticed his arrival. With
an interrogative grunt he stepped to the steering
pedestal as the man moved aside, and he
stood peering at the dimly lit compass card,
and moving the wheel a spoke or two each
way as he "felt" her.</p>

<p>"North Seventy East&mdash;carryin' a little starboard,"
said the dark figure beside him, and
he accepted the "Turn-over" with another
characteristic growl&mdash;</p>

<p>"That you, Pember? Follow the next ahead
and steer small." The Commander had spoken,
the white gleam from his scarf showing for a
moment in the reflected compass light.</p>

<p>"Next ahead and steer small, sir." He leaned
forward and watched the blue-white fan of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
phosphorus that meant the stern-wave of the
next ship. Low voices spoke beside him, and
the telegraphs whirred round and reply-gongs
tinkled. Half, or perhaps a quarter, of his
brain noticed these things, but they were
instantly pigeon-holed and forgotten. He was
at his job, and his job was to hold his course
on the next ahead. Without an order, nothing
but death would cause him to let his attention
wander from his business. He heard the sub-lieutenant
a few feet distant crooning in a
mournful voice&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How many miles to Babylon?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Three score and ten."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The back of his brain seized the words and
turned them over and over. Babylon was in
the Bible&mdash;he wasn't sure where it was on
the map though. How much was three score
and ten? Three twenties were sixty, and&mdash;"<i>Action
Stations</i>"&mdash;Babylon slid into a pigeon-hole,
and he relaxed for a second from his
rigid concentration on the next ahead. He
straightened up, stretching his long gaunt body,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and a suspicion of a smile lit his face. Then
he resumed his peering, puckered attitude,
oblivious to everything but that phosphorescent
glow ahead. The glow broadened and brightened,
and he felt the quiver beneath his feet that
told of a speed that contractors of three years
ago would have gaped at. A vivid flash of
yellow light lit up the next ahead and showed
her bridge and funnels with startling clearness
against the sky. By the same flash he saw
another big destroyer on the bow crossing the
line from starboard to port. His own bow
gun fired at the instant the detonations of the
first shots reached him, and in the midst of
the tearing reports of a round dozen of high-velocity
guns, by some miracle of concentration,
he heard a helm order from the white scarf
six feet away. The little fifteen-inch wheel
whirled under his hand, and with a complaining
quiver and roll the destroyer swung after
her leader to port. In the light of a continually
increasing number of gun-flashes he
saw the next ahead running "Yard-arm to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Yard-arm" with a long German destroyer, each
slamming shell into the other at furious speed.
He gave a side-glance to starboard to look for
his opposite number on the enemy line&mdash;and
then came one of those incidents which show
that the Navy trains men into the same mental
groove, whether officers or coxswains.</p>

<p>The enemy destroyer was just turning up to
show her port broadside. She was carrying
"Hard-over" helm, and her wheel could hardly reverse
in the time that would be necessary if&mdash;&mdash;.
The coxswain anticipated the order he knew
would come&mdash;anticipated it to the extent of a
mere fraction of port-helm and a savage grip
of the wheel. The order came in a voice that
no amount of gun-fire could prevent the coxswain
from hearing just then. "<i>Hard-a-port!</i>
<i>Ram her</i>, coxswain!" The enemy saw and
tried to meet the charge bow-on. There was
no room between them for that, and he knew
it. His guns did his best for him, but a man
intent on his job takes a lot of killing at short
range. Two shells hit and burst below the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
bridge, and the third&mdash;the coxswain swung
round the binnacle, gripping the rim with his
left hand. His right hand still held the wheel,
and spun it through a full turn of starboard
helm. The stiffened razor-edge bow took the
enemy at the break of the poop, and went
clean through before crushing back to the fore
bulkhead. At the impact the shattered coxswain
slipped forward on the deck and died
with a smashing, splintering noise in his ears&mdash;the
tribute of war to an artist whose work
was done.</p>

<h2>AN "ANNUAL."</h2>

<p>A grey drizzly morning, with yellow fog to
seaward and every prospect of a really wet day.
At each side of the black basin gates stood
a little group of men, the majority "Dockyard
mateys" of the rigger's party. A few wore
the insignia of higher rank&mdash;bowler hats and
watch-chains. The bowler hats conferred together
in low voices, while the rank and file
conferred not at all, but stared solemnly out
at the wall of mist that cut the visibility in
the harbour down to a bare four hundred
yards.</p>

<p>Round the corner of the rigger's store two
uniformed figures appeared walking briskly
towards the basin entrance. Both wore overcoats.
The shorter man was grey where the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
hair showed beneath his gold-peaked cap, while
the pale face and "washed-out" look of the
younger man indicated that the hospital ship
which took him away from Gallipoli had done
so none too soon.</p>

<p>As they approached, one of the bowler-wearers
detached himself from the group and
spoke to the senior of the two. There was a
three-cornered comparison of watches and then
a move to the wall, over the edge of which
they gazed down at the slowly moving yellow
water.</p>

<p>"We'll give her another quarter of an hour,
Mr Johnson, and then pack up," said the officer.
"I think it has cleared a little since six, and
I know they'll bring her up if they possibly
can."</p>

<p>Through the medley of horns, syrens, and
whistles that had been sounding through the
fog, four short blasts caught the ear of a rigger
who leaned against the outward capstan bollard.
He lounged forward a couple of paces, and
the men nearest looked round at him with a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
symptom of interest. The blasts sounded again,
and he turned and looked at the foreman
rigger behind him. The foreman nodded and
spoke and the group separated a little, some
of the men picking up long flexible "heaving-lines"
coiled in neat rings on the cobble-stones.</p>

<p>"She's coming, sir," said the foreman, turning
to the King's Harbourmaster; "she'll just do
it nicely. That was the new tug's whistle."</p>

<p>A couple of capstan bollards began to clatter
round as steam was turned on and a heavy
wooden fender swung with a crash over the
rounded edge of each entrance wall. The mist
was clearing now, and the traffic in the harbour
could be dimly seen. A foreman pointed to
seaward, and the younger officer followed his
arm with his tired eyes. Over the fog a
slender dark line showed with a blurred foretop
below. The unmistakable tripod mast of a
big ship showed gradually through, and as he
watched he was reminded of a magic-lantern
picture out of focus being gradually brought
into definition by the operator. The mist
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
cleared faster than she approached, and at a
quarter of a mile he could see the great looming
bow surmounted by tier on tier of bridges,
which mounted almost to the high overhanging
top. She crawled slowly on, using her own
engines, the hawsers leading to the furiously
agitated paddle tugs on bow and quarter
sweeping slack along the stream. On the tall
"monkey's island" a group of figures clustered
together, and the gleam of gold-peaked caps
showed among the blue overcoats. At half a
cable's length the voices of the leadsmen, inarticulate
and faint before, could be clearly
heard. "And a <i>ha-a-a-f</i> nine"&mdash;"and a <i>ha-a-a-f</i>
nine." The bow tugs sheered off to each side,
and whistles blew shrilly. The heavy bow
hawsers fell splashing in the water, and the
jingle of engine-room telegraph bells echoed up
the walls of the entrance. A couple of dingy
black "rigger" boats, propelled "Maltee fashion,"
with the rowers standing facing forward, appeared
between the dockyard wall and the great
curved stem. Heaving-lines sailed through the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
air, uncoiling as they flew, and the boats rowed
furiously back to the entrance. From somewhere
aft by the turret a great bull voice spoke
through a megaphone. The riggers at the
entrance leapt into sudden activity, and for five
minutes the din and clatter of capstans, shrilling
of whistles, and splash of hawsers in the water
broke the spell of silence. The noise died
suddenly, and the note of telegraph bells came
ringing again from the high grey monster.
Slowly she gathered way, and to the clatter
of the dockyard capstans as the slack of the
hawsers was taken in, her forty-foot curved
stem passed the black caisson gates. The two
officers, the young and the old, stepped to the
edge of the wall and looked across. Her stem
had hit off the exact centre of the entrance,
but there was a good two hundred yards of
her to come yet. In dead silence, with groups
of men fallen in at attention along her side,
she flowed on, her speed a bare two knots, but
a speed in keeping with her enormous bulk and
majesty. As she entered, and the finer lines
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of her bow passed, she seemed to swell, till
she almost filled the entrance, and it looked as
if one could step aboard her from the lock-side.
The eyes travelled from the mighty turret guns
that glistened in the rain, and were attracted
up and up till heads were tilted back to look
at the highest bridge of all. A quiet incisive
voice could be clearly heard: "Port ten"&mdash;"'Midships"&mdash;"Stop
both." Again the "kling-kling"
of bells and then silence. The grey-haired
officer on the wall raised his hand in
salute, and a tall grave captain, looking down
from above, saluted in return, showing a flash
of white teeth in a smile of recognition.</p>

<p>As she passed the hawsers came with her,
transferred from bollard to bollard by gangs
of staggering men. The passage of her stern
past the outer entrance seemed to break a
spell, as if the hypnotism of hundreds of staring
eyes had passed away. The caisson gates
ground to with almost indecent haste behind
her, as some castle portcullis might do as the
last prisoner was dragged through. Whistles
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
blew, answering each other across the oily,
rain-pitted water of the basin, and to the <i>weeep
we-ooo</i> of pipes and the roar of the boatswains
mates' voices, the lines of rigid men on the
great ship's side broke up and fell back. She
had left the open sea and had become "Number
955&mdash;for refit&mdash;in Dockyard hands."</p>

<p>"How long is she for, sir? Ten days?"</p>

<p>The grey-haired officer turned: "No, only
eight. They want her back as soon as possible.
Four days' leave to each watch and she'll be
off again. You're looking cold, boy&mdash;come
up to breakfast. That malaria hasn't left you
yet."</p>

<p>"I wish it would, sir. I want to get to sea
again.</p>

<p>"I know. It's not so bad to watch them
come in, but it makes me feel old when I see
them leaving again. But you needn't worry,
the War's going on a long time yet."</p>

<h2>THE SPARROW.</h2>

<p>A perfectly calm blue sea, a blazing June sun,
and absolutely nothing to break the monotony
of a blank horizon. The sparrow was deadbeat,
and was travelling slowly to the north and
west on a zigzag course, about two hundred feet
high. The sparrow had no right to be there
at all. He hailed from a Yorkshire hedgerow,
and nothing but a real three-day fog and
westerly winds could have brought him over
such a waste of waters. He had been flying
in a circle all night, swerving at intervals down
to the water in the vain hope of finding rest
for his aching muscles. Now he was heading
roughly towards his home with but slight hopes
of ever reaching it.</p>

<p>A faint droning noise to the north made him
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
turn, and low over the straight-ruled horizon
he saw a silvery-white line that every moment
grew larger. He headed towards it, but at a
mile range swerved away to pass astern of it.
It was not an inviting object for even a lost
sparrow to rest on. With engines running slow&mdash;so
slowly that the blades of the great propellors
could be easily seen&mdash;with a broad white-and-black
ensign flapping lazily below and
astern, the Zeppelin droned on to the south'ard,
a thing of massive grace and beauty on such a
perfect summer's day.</p>

<p>With a vague idea that the monster might
lead him home, the sparrow turned and followed.
The Zeppelin slowly drew ahead and rose higher,
while far to the south another monster rose
over the skyline, black against the sun. The
great craft passed each other and turned away,
the first one heading back to the north whence
he had come, and the second disappearing to the
east, climbing slowly as he went.</p>

<p>The sparrow turned also and fluttered and
dipped in pathetic confidence after his first
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
visitor. The fact of having seen <i>something</i>,
however unpleasant and strange-looking, had
given him a new access of strength, and he was
able to keep the great silver thing in easy view.
Suddenly the Zeppelin tilted like a hunter at a
high fence, and the note of his engines rose to
a dull roar. He climbed like&mdash;well, like a
sparrow coming up to a house-top&mdash;and at three
thousand feet he circled at full power, levelling
off his angle, and showing a turn of speed which
left the frightened bird gaping.</p>

<p>The sparrow fluttered on vaguely, passing at
100 feet above the water, below the Zeppelin.
He had decided that a pilot who played tricks
like that was no sort of use to him, and that he
had better stick to his original idea of working
to the north and west, however lonely a course
it might be. He swerved a little at a rushing,
whistling noise that came from above him, and
which grew to a terrifying note. A big dark
object whipped past him, and a moment later
splashed heavily into the mirror-like surface
below. The rings made by its impact had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
hardly started to widen, when there was a
great convulsion, and a column of smoky-white
water leapt up behind him, followed by the
roar of an explosion. The sparrow started to
climb&mdash;to climb as he had never done in his
life. Twice more&mdash;his weariness forgotten&mdash;he
was urged to further efforts to gain height,
by the shock of the great detonations from
the water below. The Zeppelin was down to
a thousand feet now, swinging round on a
wider circle. Five hundred feet below, the
sparrow saw a faint streak on the water which
faded at one end into blue sea, and at the
other narrowed to a little feather of spray
round a dark point that was travelling like
the fin of some slowly moving fish to the north-westward.
The Zeppelin saw it too, and came
hunting back along the line. Bang&mdash;bang&mdash;bang!
Great columns shot up again ahead
and astern of the strange fish, and away went
the sparrow to the south once more. Any
course was bad in this place, and it was better
to die alone in the waters than to be pursued
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
by such a monster of the air. As he went he
heard more and more detonations behind him,
until the noise of the droning engine had died,
when he was again alone over the sparkling
unfriendly sea. The exertions and alarm of
the last hour had taken the last of his reserve
forces, and in uneven flutterings his flight
tended lower and lower, till he was a bare
twenty feet from what he knew must be his
grave. Then came a miracle of war. A bare
quarter-mile ahead a thing like a tapering lance
began to rise and grow from the water. It
was followed by a grey black-lettered tower
which also grew and showed a rounded grey
hull, moving slowly south with a white band
of froth spinning away astern. A lid on the
tower clanged open, and two figures appeared.
One raised something to his eye, and faced
south. The other stood on the rail and pivoted
slowly round, staring at sky and sea.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the deuce he was bombing&mdash;bit
of wreckage, I suppose," said the man
on the rail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
    "Well, it wasn't us anyway. The blind old
baby-killer." The man with the sextant
lowered it and fiddled with the shades. "<i>We've</i>
got no boats near, have we, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not for donkeys' miles. I hope it was a
Fritz, anyway. I say, look at that spadger!"</p>

<p>"Where? I don't see it. Stand by. Stop,
sir."</p>

<p>"All right, I got you. Here, catch this
watch. That spadger's gone down into the
casing, and he'll drown if we dip with him
there. Look out for those Zepps. coming back."</p>

<p>The Captain swung quickly down the foreside
of the conning-tower, ran forward and peered
into the casing in the eyes of the boat.</p>

<p>"Zepp. coming, sir,&mdash;north of us, just gone
behind a bit of cloud."</p>

<p>"Zepp. be damned. Ah! got you, you little
beggar." He reached his arm into a coil of
wet rope and rose triumphantly to his feet.
The sparrow cheeped pitifully as he ran aft
again and took the ladder in two jumps. He
gave a glance astern and another all round
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the horizon before following his sextant-clutching
subordinate below. The lid clanged,
and with a sigh, a gurgle, and a flirt of her
screws the submarine slid under, the blank
and expressionless eye of her periscope staring
fixedly at an unconscious but triumphant
Zeppelin that was gliding out from a fleecy
patch of cloud astern.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>"Here you are, Lizzie. Skipper said I was
to let him go soon's we got in, but I just
brought 'im to show you. We've 'ad 'im aboard
five days now, and 'e can't 'alf eat biscuit. 'E's
as full as 'e can 'old now. Open the window,
old girl, and we'll let 'im out afore I starts
'ugging yer."</p>

<p>The lid of the cap-box opened wide and the
sparrow hopped to the table. He raised his
cramped wings and fluffed out his feathers as
he felt his muscles again. There was a flutter
and a flip of his impudent tail, and quicker
than the eye could follow him the wanderer
was gone.</p>

<h2>A WAR WEDDING.</h2>

<p>Old Bill Dane? Yes, he's married now. We
got a week's refitting leave, and I've just been
seeing him through it. Ye&mdash;es, there was a bit
of a hitch when they were engaged, but&mdash;&mdash;Well,
I'll tell you the story. I saw most of it,
because I was sort of doing second for him then
too. You see, he and I got it rather in the neck
in the August scrap, and we came out of hospital
together. I had a smashed leg and he had a
scalp wound. Nothing to write home about, but
it didn't make any more of a Venus of him
when it healed. They sent us on sick-leave, and
we stayed with his people. His guvnor's the eye
specialist, you know&mdash;got a home in town, and
keeps the smell of iodoform in Harley Street, and
doesn't let it come into the house. We were all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
right. We led the quiet life, and just pottered
around, and saw the shows and so on. We gave
the social life a miss until Bill's sister let us
in. Bill didn't want to go, but she put it to
me, and as I was sort of her guest I had to
make him come. Who? The sister? Oh! all
right, you know. Don't be a fool, or I won't
tell you the yarn. Well, she took us poodlefaking,
and it cost me a bit at Gieves' for new
rig, too. It was about our third stunt that
way when Bill got into trouble. We were at
some bally great house belonging to a stockbroker
or bookie or some one, and they were
doing fox-trots up and down the drawing-room,
and Bill and I were rather out of it. I was
lame and he's no dancing man, unless it's just
dressed in a towel or two to amuse guests in the
wardroom when there's a bit of table-turning
going on. Some woman came and told him he'd
got to join up, and took him over to the girl.
She was dressed regular war-flapper fashion,
you know, like a Bank of Expectation cheque,
except she hadn't got a top-hat on as some of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
them had lately. Most of 'em in the room were
togged out like that, and Bill and I had just
agreed we didn't go much on the style at all,
but Bill is a proper lamb about women. He
did one turn of the room with the girl, dancing
a sort of Northern Union style, and then she
stopped, and he brought her over to me and
plumped her on the sofa between us. I think
he wanted to see if I was laughing. She started
on me at once, and asked me all about my leg
and Bill's head, and talked like a Maxim. Asked
me if we were great friends, and made me
laugh. I said we had only forgathered because
I had beaten him in the middle-weights in the
Grand Fleet championships, and though I had
never seen his face before, his left stop had
touched my heart. She dropped me then&mdash;she
thought I was pulling her leg&mdash;and turned to
Bill, and then his sister took me off to get her
tea. I didn't realise Bill was getting soft about
it till his sister told me, though the fact of our
going to tea and dinner at the girl's home that
week had seemed funny to me at the time.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
The sister was rather pleased about it&mdash;said she
knew the girl and liked her. I said I didn't
think much of that sort, but she smoothed me
down a bit. She thought that they would do
each other good. I said Bill was such an old
lamb he'd only get sloppy, and do what the
girl told him; but she laughed. She told me I
might know Jim in the ring, but I didn't know
much about him otherwise. I was rather shirty
at that, but I think now she was talking sense,
though I didn't then. Well, Bill can get quite
busy when he makes his mind up, and the way
he rushed that girl was an education to watch.
They were engaged in ten days from the first
time we went to her house, and I don't think
we missed seeing her for more than twelve hours
in that time. I? Oh, I and the sister were
chaperons. I didn't mind. I was sorry for Bill,
but I wasn't going to spoil things for him if
he was set on it.</p>

<p>The girl's people were all right. They were
rather the Society type, you know&mdash;thought
London was capital of the world, and that a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Gotha bomb in the West End ought to mean a
new Commander-in-Chief to relieve Haig; but
they were quite decent.</p>

<p>The trouble? Well, I'm coming to that. It
came about a week after they had announced
the engagement. Old Bill had been getting a
bit restive over things. You see, he had begun
to wonder just where <i>he</i> came into the business.
He wanted to get the girl off by her lonesome
to a desert island, and tell her what a peach
she was, for the rest of her natural life; but
the girl hadn't got an inkling of what he thought
about it. He was towed round like a pet bear
and told to enjoy himself, while people talked
over his head. She was just a kid, and she
didn't know. It seemed to her that being engaged
was good fun, and getting married was a
matter they could think about later, when she'd
had time to consider it. She was all for the
tango-tea and the latest drawing-room crazes. I
didn't feel enthusiastic about his affairs, and I
told the sister so; but she laughed about it all.
I didn't. The girl, Hilda&mdash;her name was Hilda
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Conron&mdash;was just like a kid with a toy. She
took him around and showed him off, and she
went on quacking away to all her pals as if
Bill wasn't in the room. She seemed to take it
for granted he was going to join up with her
crowd and learn to do the same tricks and talk
the same patter as they did. Bill certainly
tried; but they treated him like a fool, and he
told me several times he felt like one. Well
then, we came to the smash. Lord, it <i>was</i> a queer
show, and I'd sooner have had my leg off than
have missed it. We were taken off to a charity
auction, Red Cross or something, where they
sold bits of A. A. shell with the Government
marks on them as bits of Zepp. bombs, and
Pekinese dogs for a hundred quid or so. After
the sale, about twenty of the household and the
guests that had paid most clustered round to
add up the takings and drink tea and talk.
Miss Conron had been selling things, and was
dressed up to the nines. There was a bishop
there, and some young staff officers and some
civilians, M.P.'s, or editors or something like that.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Old Bill was sitting with me and his sister,
looking like a family lawyer at a funeral, and
the girl was perched on a sofa with a lanky
shopwalker-looking bloke alongside her. He
was an indispensable of sorts&mdash;Secretary to the
Minister of some bloomin' thing or other. He
was the lad, I tell you,&mdash;sort of made you feel
you were waiting on the mat when he talked.
He was laying down the law about the War
and all about it, and he talked like all the
Angels at a Peace Conference. But it was the
bishop that put his foot in the mulligatawny
first. He agreed with the smooth-haired draper-man
about the need of peace, but he said we
should see that Germany provided suitable reparation
for Belgium. Bill sat up and got red
and stuttered, and said: "I don't think Germany
or anybody can give Belgium back what she
has lost."</p>

<p>They all looked at Bill as if he had just
dawned on them, and Bill looked more foolish.
The draper-man shipped an eyeglass and looked
him over like a new specimen. "Ah!" he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
said, "our naval friend? Perhaps you will tell
us in what way you consider the War can be
ended before the world comes to economic ruin.
Must we wait until you have had your fill
of fighting or have destroyed the High Sea
Fleet?"</p>

<p>Bill stood up and stopped looking silly. Miss
Dane leaned back in her chair, and I heard
her sigh as if she was pleased about something.</p>

<p>"Never mind the High Sea Fleet," said Bill.
"That's not your business to worry about. But
as to 'fill of fighting,' you've said it there.
When we've had our fill of fighting Germany
will have had more, but we're a long way from
that yet."</p>

<p>The long stiff turned to Miss Conron. "Why,
little Miss Hilda," he said, "your fiancé is
charming. He should speak in the Park on
Sundays and we would all come to listen."</p>

<p>The girl got red and looked daggers at Bill.
She didn't like his making a fool of himself,
and she wanted him back in his chair again.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
The long man put a hand on her knee and
spoke quietly to her, and she shook her head
at him and laughed. That did it. My oath!
that did it all right. Bill shrugged his shoulders
back and took station in the outer ring of
draper-worshippers, and spoke like a&mdash;a Demosthenes.</p>

<p>"You blank, blank, blank," he said, "get off
that sofa and get away from Miss Conron."</p>

<p>The Bishop looked as if the end of the world
had come and he was adrift with his cash
accounts. The staff officers looked blank and
the women got scary. I got up and took
station on Bill's quarter in case any one got
excited. The long man put up his glass again
and showed symptoms of an approaching
oration.</p>

<p>"You stay then, you half-breed dog," said
Bill; "I'm going to talk to you." Bill put his
hands in his coat pockets and looked around.
"Now listen," he said; "I'm talking for a lot
of men who aren't here. <i>We're</i> fighting this
show, and there are some millions of us. Who
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
are you to talk of War or Peace? By God, if
you try and pack up we'll put you to work
again. If you're going to compromise with
Germany, we won't. Have you forgotten what
the Germans can do? My oath, you make
me sick. What can it matter if the nations
are all broken and ruined so long as we smash
Germany? <i>We</i> don't want money and luxuries
to fight on. Give us food and munitions till
we have done what we started to do. You
whining people&mdash;what do you know of it?
Have you got no guts at all? Have you read
the Bryce Report? Yes, I bet you have, and
locked it away so that your women shouldn't
see it. I tell you, it doesn't matter to us, and
we're about four million men, if we are all
killed so long as we kill eight million Huns.
I know a sergeant who has killed five Prussian
officers, and I think he's a real man, not like
you. He took to it after he saw a five-year-old
girl with her hands cut off hanging like
a sucking-pig on a meat-hook in a wrecked
French village. Doesn't that make you feel
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
it? I tell you, if you play the fool behind
our backs we'll take charge of you. Yes,
Bishop, you'll keep up the good work in a
munition factory, and you'll work hard too.
If you can't be a patriot now, you will be when
you've been caned across your lathe."</p>

<p>They were as still as mice, and the rumble
of traffic along Piccadilly sounded very loud.
Miss Conron was as white as a sheet, and
her eyes were staring as if she were scared
to death. Bill took a long breath and
went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've tried to see your point of view while
I've been among you, and I can't. I'm going
to leave you and get back to my own lot. I'm
giving up something I didn't think I could
give up, but I won't join you just to get it.
There are not so many of us as there are of
you, but you'll do what you're told if we take
charge. Most of us have seen dead men, and
some of us have seen dead women. None of
you have seen either, and you don't understand.
You want to hide things away and pretend
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
they're not there. They <i>are</i> there, and they
are going on wherever the Germans are, you
fools. There's a man here who has been impertinent
to me because he thinks I'm a fool.
I'm a better man than any six of his sort, and
I'm going to show him how. It will do the
rest of you good to watch, because you haven't
seen death yet, and a man with a bruise or
two will seem a big thing to you. Come along,
my sofa-king, you're for it."</p>

<p>Bill walked up to him with his hands down
and the women began to squeal. The draper-man
was game. He took a step forward and
swung his right. Bill hooked him under the
chin and gave him the left in the stomach.
The poor beggar backed off, taking a wicked
upper-cut as he did so. As he straightened
again Bill sent a couple of full swings to his
head. He was going down, but Bill wouldn't
let him. I think if he hadn't been so clever
with Miss Conron on the sofa he would have
got off fairly cheap, but a girl makes a lot
of difference to any scrap. He took about six
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
more before he hit the deck, and then he
looked like a Belgian atrocity picture by
Raemaekers. Bill came over to me and
signalled his sister to the door. She moved
off. My oath, she hadn't turned a hair&mdash;she's
a sportsman. He looked across at Miss
Conron, who was still on the sofa looking at
the huddled figure in the middle of the carpet.
"I'm going now, Hilda," he said; "your people
aren't my people. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>She never moved, but the colour had come
back into her face again. Bill shrugged back
his shoulders and turned his back, and we
started for the door. Miss Dane was there,
holding the handle and looking past us at the
horrified group we had left. As we got almost
up to her she smiled and came to Bill. She
took him by the shoulders and turned him
round, and I turned to see what she was
looking at. Miss Conron was walking that
sixty-foot plank after us, and I knew when
I saw her face that she and Bill were going
to be all right. She didn't say anything, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the four of us went out, and Bill kissed her
in the hall in front of the servants. Trouble?
No&mdash;not much. You see, Bill had had a scalp
wound, and they put it all down to that. The
draper-man didn't want to publish things much,
and Miss Conron's father has got a bit of a
pull. If he had no kick coming other people
could shut up, and&mdash;oh yes! Sound as a bell&mdash;he
wouldn't have got married otherwise.
But, by gum, his sister was right&mdash;wasn't she?</p>

<h2>THE "SPECIAL."</h2>

<p>She was not new, and nobody could call her
handsome. She was evidently more accustomed
to rough weather than paint, and her sloping
forecastle and low freeboard were old-fashioned,
to say the least of them. She jogged slowly
along, rolling to a short beam sea, with an
apologetic air, as if she felt ashamed of being
what she was&mdash;a pre-war torpedo-boat on local
patrol duty.</p>

<p>She steered no particular course, and varied
her speed capriciously as she beat up and down.
Being in sight of the land&mdash;a grey, hard, low
line to the westward&mdash;there was no need for
accurate plotting of courses. On the bridge
stood her Captain, a dark, lean, R.N.R. Lieutenant,
pipe in mouth and hands in "lammy"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
pockets. The T.B. was rolling too much for
any one to walk the tiny deck of the bridge;
in fact, a landsman would have had difficulty
in standing at all. He turned his head as his
First Lieutenant swung up the little iron ladder
behind him.</p>

<p>"What's for lunch?" he asked, carefully
knocking out his pipe on the rail before him.</p>

<p>"The same," said his laconic subordinate, who
was engaged in a rapid survey of the compass
card, revolution indicator, and the horizon astern.
The two stood side by side a moment looking
out at the sea and sky to windward. "Any
pickles?" said the Captain.</p>

<p>"No, only mustard."</p>

<p>The Captain sighed and turned to leave the
bridge. The First Lieutenant pivoted suddenly&mdash;"It's
better'n you and I had off the Horn in
the <i>Harvester</i>. You'd 've been glad to get beef
then, even if it was in a tin." He snorted,
and turned forward again to look ahead. The
Captain remained at the foot of the ladder,
reading a signal handed to him by a waiting
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Boy Telegraphist. The argument on the subject
of tinned beef had lasted a year already, and
could be continued at leisure.</p>

<p>The boy received the signal back and vanished
below, while the Captain climbed slowly to the
bridge again. He spoke to the man at the
wheel, and himself moved the revolution
indicator.</p>

<p>"Panic?" said the First Lieutenant (neither
of them seemed to use more than one word
at a time, unless engaged in an argument).</p>

<p>"Sure," was the reply. "Tell 'em to make
that blinkin' stuff into sandwiches and send
'em up."</p>

<p>The First Lieutenant went down the ladder
in silence. The matter of the tinned beef was
to him, as mess caterer, a continual sore point.</p>

<p>The T.B. started on a more erratic course
than before, tacking in long irregular stretches
out to seaward. Smoke was showing up
against the land astern, and there was a sense
of stirring activity in the air.</p>

<p>Two more torpedo-boats appeared suddenly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
from nowhere, hoists of coloured flags flying
at their slender masts. The three hung on
one course a moment, conferring, then spread
fanwise and separated. The first boat turned
back towards harbour and the growing smoke-puffs,
which rapidly approached and showed
more and more mine-sweepers coming out.</p>

<p>A droning, humming noise made the Captain
look up, and he pivoted slowly round, following
with his eyes a big seaplane a thousand feet
above him.</p>

<p>As the sound of the engines died away, it
seemed to start swelling again, as another
machine appeared a mile abeam of them, and
following the first.</p>

<p>The T.B. swung round ahead of the leading
sweepers, and turned back to seaward. Her
speed was not great, but half an hour after
the turn the sweepers were hull down astern.
A small airship slipped out of a low cloud and
droned away on the common course. Every
type of small craft seemed to be going easterly,
and the sea, which an hour ago had been almost
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
blank, was now dotted with patrol ships of
every queer kind and rig. From overhead it
must have looked like a pack of hounds
tumbling out of cover and spreading on a faint
line. But, like the hounds, the floating pack
was working to an end, and whatever the
various courses steered, the whole was moving
out to sea.</p>

<p>The Boy Telegraphist hauled himself, panting,
on to the bridge, and thrust a crumpled signal
before the Captain's eyes. The Captain grunted
and spoke shortly, and the boy dashed off
below. A moment later the piping of calls
sounded along the bare iron deck, and men in
heavy sea-boots began to cluster aft and at the
guns. The funnels sent out a protesting spout
of brown smoke as the T.B. began to work up
to her speed, and the choppy sea sent up a
steady sheet of spray along her forecastle and
over the crouching figures at the bow gun.
The rest of the pack appeared to have caught
the whimper too, for everything that could
raise more than "Tramp's pace" was hurrying
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
due east. A faint dull "boom" came drifting
down wind as the First Lieutenant arrived on
the bridge, and the two officers looked at each
other in silence a moment.</p>

<p>"Bomb, sir?" said the junior, showing an
interest which almost made him conversational.</p>

<p>"Sure thing," said the other. "She gave us
the tip when she saw him, and that'll be one
to put him under."</p>

<p>"How far d'you think it was?"</p>

<p>"Seven-eight mile. You all ready?"</p>

<p>The First Lieutenant nodded and slipped
down the ladder again. Three miles astern
came a couple of white specks&mdash;the bow-waves
of big destroyers pushed to their utmost power.
The Captain studied them a moment with his
binoculars, and gave a grunt which the helmsman
rightly interpreted as one of satisfaction.
Slow as she was, the old T.B. had a long start,
and was going to be on the spot first. The
dark was shutting down, and the shapes of the
other T.B.'s on either beam were getting dim.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
    The night was starlit, and with the wind
astern the T.B. made easy weather of it. The
two officers leaned forward over the rail staring
ahead towards the unseen land. Lights showed
on either hand, and occasionally they swung
past the dark squat shape of a lit trawler, also
bound home.</p>

<p>"Are you going to claim?" asked one of the
watching figures. The other paused before
replying&mdash;</p>

<p>"We-ell," he said, "I'll just report. I think
we shook him to the bunt, but it's no good
claiming unless you can show prisoners, Iron
Cross and all." Another ruminative pause.
"Your people were smart on it&mdash;devilish smart."
Another pause. "What's for dinner?"</p>

<p>A dark mass ahead came into view, and
turned slowly into a line of great ships coming
towards them.</p>

<p>The T.B. swung off to starboard, and slowed
her engines. One by one they went past her&mdash;huge,
silent, and scornful, while the T.B.
rocked uneasily in the cross sea made by their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
wakes. The Captain watched them go, chewing
the stem of his unlit pipe. They were the
cause of the day's activity, but it was seldom
he met them at close range except like this, in
the dark on his way home.</p>

<p>The line seemed endless, more and more dark
hulls coming into view, and fading quickly
into the dark again. As the last swung by
the T.B.'s telegraph bells rang cheerfully, and
she jogged off westward to where a faint low
light flickered at intervals under the land.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<h2>BETWEEN TIDES.</h2>

<p>A stranger, if suddenly transplanted to the
spot, would have taken some time after opening
his eyes to realise that the boat was submerged.
He would probably decide at first that she was
anchored in harbour. Far away forward, under
an avenue of overhead electric lamps, figures
could be seen&mdash;all either recumbent or seated&mdash;and
from them the eye was led on till it lost
its sense of distance in a narrowing perspective
of wheels, pipes, and gauges. All the while
there was a steady buzzing hum from slowly
turning motors, and about every half minute
there came a faint whir of gear wheels from
away aft by the hydroplanes. From the bell-mouths
of a cluster of voice-pipes a murmur
of voices sounded&mdash;the conversation of officers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
by the periscope; while the ear, if close to the
arched steel hull, could catch a bubbling, rippling
noise&mdash;the voice of the North Sea passing
overhead.</p>

<p>The men stationed aft near the motors were
not over-clean, and were certainly unshaven;
some were asleep or reading (the literature
carried and read by the crew would certainly
have puzzled a librarian&mdash;it varied from 'Titbits'
and 'John Bull' to 'Piers Plowman' and
'The Origin of Species'): a few were engaged
in a heated discussion as they sat around a
big torpedoman&mdash;the only man of the group
actually on duty at the moment. His duties
appeared only to consist in being awake and on
the spot if wanted, and he was, as a matter of
fact, fully occupied as one of the leading spirits
in the argument.</p>

<p>"Well, let's '<i>ear</i> what you're getting at," he
said. "We 'eard a lot of talk, but it don't go
anywhere. You say you're a philosopher, but
you don't know what you do mean."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> know blanky well, but you can't understand
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
me," said the engine-room artificer addressed.
"Look here, now&mdash;you've got to die
some time, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Granted, Professor."</p>

<p>"Well, it's all arranged <i>now</i> how you're to
die, I say. It doesn't matter when or how
it is, but it's all settled&mdash;see? And you
don't know, and none of us know anything
about it."</p>

<p>"That's all very well&mdash;but 'oo is it knows,
then? D'you mean God?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't&mdash;I'm an atheist, I tell you.
There's <i>something</i> that arranges it all, but it
ain't God."</p>

<p>"Well, 'oo the 'ell is it, then&mdash;the Admiralty?"</p>

<p>The Artificer leaned forward, his dark eyes
alight and his face earnest as that of some
medieval hermit. "I tell you," he said, "you
can believe in God, or Buddha, or anything
you like, but it's the same thing. Whatever
it is, it doesn't care. It has it all ready and
arranged&mdash;written out, if you like&mdash;and it will
have to happen just so. It's pre&mdash;pre&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
    "Predestination." The deep voice came from
the Leading Stoker on the bench beside him.</p>

<p>"Predestination. No amount of praying's any
good. It's no use going round crying to gods
that aren't there to help you. You've got to
go through it as it's written down."</p>

<p>"Prayer's all right," said the Leading Stoker.
"If you believe what you pray, you'll get it."</p>

<p>"That's not true. Have you ever had it?
Give us an instance now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't pray none, thank you. All the same,
it's good for women and such that go in for it,
like. It ain't the things that alter; it's yourself
that does it. Ain't you never 'eard o' Christian
Science?"</p>

<p>"Yes; same as the Mormons, ain't it? Is
that what you are?"</p>

<p>"No, it ain't&mdash;an' I'm a Unitarian, same as
you are."</p>

<p>"I'm not&mdash;I'm a Baptist, same as my father
was; but I don't believe in it."</p>

<p>"Well, if you believe in one God, that's what
you are."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
    "But I'm telling you, I <i>don't</i>. Look here, now.
I don't believe there's anything happens at all
that wasn't all arranged first, and I know that
nothing can alter it."</p>

<p>"Well, 'oo laid it all down first go off, then?"
said the Torpedoman.</p>

<p>"Ah! I don't know and you don't know; but
I tell you it wasn't God."</p>

<p>"Well, 'e's a bigger man than me then, an' I
takes me 'at off to 'im, 'ooever it is. I tell yer,
yer talkin' through yer neck. You say if you're
going to be shot, there's a bullet about somewhere
in some one's pouch with yer name writ
on it. Ain't that it? Well, 'oo the 'ell put yer
name on it, then?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter to me so long's it's there,
does it?"</p>

<p>"Well, if that was so, I'd like to know 'oo 'e
was, so's I could pass 'im the word not to 'ave the
point filed off of it for me, anyway."</p>

<p>"Well, you couldn't&mdash;and he couldn't alter
it for you if he was there, either."</p>

<p>The Torpedoman moved along the bench and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
twisted his head round till his ear was against
one of the voice-pipes. The others sat silent
and watched him with lazy interest.</p>

<p>"We're takin' a dip," he said. "Thought I
'eard 'im say, 'Sixty feet.'" The faint rolling
motion that had been noticeable before died
away, and the boat seemed to have become even
more peaceful and silent. The Leading Stoker
leaned back against the hull and rested his head
against the steel. From the starboard hand
there came a faint murmur, which grew till
the regular threshing beat of a propeller could
be distinguished. The sound swelled till they
could hear in its midst a separate piping,
squeaking note. The ship passed on overhead,
and the threshing sound passed with her and
faded until again the steady purr of motors
remained the only reminder of the fact that
the boat was diving. They felt her tilt up a
little by the bow as she climbed back to regain
her patrol depth.</p>

<p>"That's a tramp," said the Torpedoman;
"nootral, I reckon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
    "Squeaky bearing, too," said the Artificer
judicially. "Don't suppose he's looked at his
thrust since he left port. What's the skipper
want to go under her for?"</p>

<p>"Save trouble, I s'pose; didn't want to alter
helm for 'er. What was you talkin' of&mdash;yes,
Kismet&mdash;that's the word I've been wantin' all
along. You're a Mohammedan, you are?"</p>

<p>"Aw, don't be a fool; I tell you I'm nothing."</p>

<p>The fourth wakeful figure, another Torpedoman,
spoke for the first time. "If you're nothing,
and you think you're nothing, what the 'ell
d'yer want to make such a fuss about it for?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't make a fuss. It's all you people who
think you're something who make a fuss. You
can't alter what's laid down, but you think you
can. You fuss and panic to stave things off,
but you're like chickens in a coop&mdash;you can't
get out till your master lets you, and he can't
understand what you say, and he wouldn't pay
any attention to it if he did."</p>

<p>The big Torpedoman put out a hand like a
knotted oak-root and spoke&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
    "You an' your Kismet," he said scornfully.
"Look 'ere, now. This is Gospel, and <i>I'm</i> tellin'
of yer. S'pose there <i>is</i> a bullet about with your
name on it, but s'posing you shoot the other &mdash;&mdash; first,
and there's to 'ell with yer Kismet.
Gawd 'elps those that 'elp themselves, I say.
S'pose we 'it a Fritz now, under water&mdash;'oo's
Kismet is it? Never mind 'oo's arranged it or
'oo's down in the book to go through it, the
bloke that gets 'is doors closed first and 'as the
best trained crew is goin' to come 'ome and spin
the yarn about it. I say it may be written
down as you say, but there's Someone 'oldin'
the book, an' 'e says: 'Cross off that boat this
time,' 'e say. 'They've got the best lot aboard
of 'em,' 'e'd say. Is it Kismet if yer thrust
collars go? Are you goin' to stop oilin' 'em
because it's in the book an' you can't alter it?
Yer talkin' through yer neck. Call it luck,
if yer like. It's luck if we 'it a mine, and
it's luck if we don't; but if we met a Fritz
to-night an' poop off the bow gun an' miss&mdash;that's
goin' to be our blanky fault, an'
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
you can call it any blanky name, but you
won't alter it."</p>

<p>"But you don't understand," said the Artificer.
"I didn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Action Stations&mdash;Stand by all tubes.</i>" The
voice rang clearly from the mouth of the voice-pipe,
and the group leapt into activity. For
sixty seconds there was apparent pandemonium&mdash;the
purr of the motors rose to a quick hum,
and the long tunnel of the hull rang with noises,
clatter and clang and hiss. The sounds stopped
almost as suddenly as they had begun, and the
voices of men reporting "Ready" could be heard
beyond the high-pitched note of the motors.</p>

<p>The big Torpedoman stretched across his
tube to close a valve, and caught the eye of the
fourth participant in the recent debate. "Say,
Dusty," he whispered, "'<i>ere's</i> Someone's Kismet&mdash;in
this blanky tube, an' I reckon I ain't
forgot the detonator in 'er nose, neither."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The Captain lowered the periscope, his actions
almost reverent in their artificial calm. He
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
looked up at the navigating officer a few feet
away and smiled. "Just turning to east," he
said. "We'll be in range inside three minutes."
He glanced fore and aft the boat and then back
at his watch. "By gum," he said, "it's nice to
have a good crew. I haven't had to give a
single order, and I wouldn't change a man of
'em."</p>

<h2>LIGHT CAVALRY.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Peter Mottin was an acting Sub-Lieutenant,
but even acting Sub-Lieutenants from Whale
Island may hunt if they can get the requisite
day's leave and can muster the price of a hired
mount. The hounds poured out of Creech Wood,
and Mottin glowed with intense delight as his
iron-mouthed horse took the rails in and out of
the lane and followed the pack up the seventy-acre
pasture from whence the holloa had come.
It was late in a February afternoon, and most
of the dispirited field had gone home, so that
there was no crowd&mdash;and a February fox on a
good scenting day is a customer worth waiting
for. Mottin sat back as a five-foot cut and laid
hedge grew nearer, and blessed the owner of his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
mount as the big black cleared the jump with
half a foot to spare. Two more big fences, cut
as level as a rule, and the field was down to six,
with three Hunt servants. The fox was making
for Hyden Wood, and scent was getting better
every minute. A clattering canter through a
farmyard, and Mottin followed the huntsman
over a ramshackle gate on to grass again. The
huntsman capped the tail-hounds on as he
galloped, and Mottin realised that if they were
going to kill before dark they would have to
drive their fox fast. Riding to his right he
saw Sangatte&mdash;a destroyer officer, whom he
knew only by name, but whom he envied for
the fact that he seemed able to hunt when he
liked and could afford to keep his own horses.
As they neared a ragged bullfinch hedge at the
top of a long slope, he saw Sangatte put on
speed and take it right in the middle, head
down and forearm across his eyes. Mottin
eased his horse to give the huntsman room at
the gate in the left-hand corner. The pilot's
horse rapped the top bar slightly, and as Mottin
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
settled himself for the leap, he saw the gate
begin to swing open away from him. There
was no time to change his mind&mdash;he decided he
must jump big and trust to luck, but the black
horse failed him. The hireling knew enough to
think for himself, and seeing the gate begin
to swing, decided that a shorter stride would
be safer. The disagreement resulted&mdash;as such
differences of opinion are liable to do&mdash;in a
crash of breaking wood and a whirling, stunning
fall. Mottin rose shakily on one leg, feeling as
if the ankle of the other was being drilled with
red-hot needles, and swore at the black horse
as it galloped with trailing bridle down the
long stubble field towards Soberton Down. He
saw Sangatte look back and then wrench his
brown mare round to ride off the hireling as it
passed. He caught the dangling reins and
swung both horses round, and came hurrying
and impatient back. As he arrived he checked
the mare and turned in his saddle to watch
the receding pack.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said. "<i>Quick</i>&mdash;you'll catch
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
'em at Hyden." He turned to look at Mottin
by the gate-post, in irritation at feeling no
snatch at the black horse's rein. His face fell
slightly. "Hullo&mdash;hurt?" he said, and leapt
from his mare.</p>

<p>"Go on. Don't wait. Go <i>on</i>," said Mottin.
"I'll be all right. You get on&mdash;it's only my
ankle."</p>

<p>"Damn painful too, I expect. I'm not going
on. They'll be at Butser before I could catch
them now, and I bet they whip off in the
dark." He threw the reins over the mare's head
and left her standing. "Now," he said. "It's
your left ankle; come here to the near side,
and put your left knee on my hands and jump
for it."</p>

<p>Mottin complied, and to the accompaniment
of a grunt and a pain-expelled oath arrived
back in the muddy saddle.</p>

<p>"I say, this is good of you&mdash;you know," he
said; "but you've&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut it out&mdash;it won't be anything of a run,
anyway," lied Sangatte gloomily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
    "Come along&mdash;it's only three miles to
Droxford, but you'll have to walk all the way,
and we'd better get on."...</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The big seaplane circled low over the harbour
and then headed seaward, climbing slowly.
There were two men aboard&mdash;a young Sub-Lieutenant
as pilot and Mottin as observer.
Mottin sat crouched low and leaning forward
as he studied the chart-holder before him and
scratched times and notes in his log-book.
They were off on a routine patrol, but there
was the additional interest to the trip that
on "information received" they were to pay a
little more attention than usual to a particular
locality.</p>

<p>From his seat Mottin could see nothing of
the pilot but his head and shoulders&mdash;a back
view only, and that obscured by swathings of
leather and wool. The two men's heads were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
joined by a cumbersome arrangement of listeners
and tubes which, theoretically, made conversation
practicable. As a matter of fact, the
invariable rule of repeating every observation
twice, and of adding embroidery to each repetition,
pointed to a discrepancy between the
theory and practice of the instrument. The
machine was a big one, and its engines were
in proportion. The accommodation in the
broad fuselage was considerable, but on the
present trip the missing units of the crew
were accounted for by an equal weight of
extra petrol and T.N.T. "eggs."</p>

<p>The morning had been hazy and they had
delayed their start till nearly noon. It was
not as clear as it might be even then, for in a
quarter of an hour from leaving the slip the
land was out of sight astern. At a thousand
feet the pilot levelled off and ceased to climb.
He flew mechanically, his head bent down to
stare at the compass-card. At times he fiddled
with air and throttle, twisting his head to
watch the revolution indicator. The occasional
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
bumping and rocking of the machine he corrected
automatically without looking up. He
had long ago arrived at the state of airmanship
which makes a pilot into a sensitive inclinometer,
acting every way at once.</p>

<p>Mottin finished his scribbling and sat up to
look round. He raised himself till he sat on
the back of his seat, and began to sweep the
sea and horizon with a pair of large-field
glasses. The wind roared past him, pressing
his arm to his side as he faced to one side or
the other, and making him strain the heavy
glasses close to his eyes to keep them steady.
An hour after starting he touched the pilot on
the shoulder and shouted into his own transmitter.
He waited a few seconds and shouted
again, with the conventional oath to drive the
sound along. The pilot nodded his swathed
and helmeted head and swung the machine
round to a new course. Mottin crouched down
again and began to study his chart afresh.
Navigation was easy so long as the weather
was clear, but with poor visibility, which might
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
get worse instead of better, he knew that it
was remarkably easy to get lost in the North
Sea, and at this moment he wanted to see
his landfall particularly clearly. Five minutes
later he saw it, and signalled a new course to
the pilot by a nudge and a jerk of his gloved
hand. A low dark line had appeared on the
starboard bow, a line with tall spires and
chimneys standing up from it at close intervals.
The seaplane banked a little as they turned
and headed away, leaving the land to recede
and fade on their quarter. The hazy sun was
low in the west and the mist was clearing. It
had been none too warm throughout the
journey, but it was now distinctly cold, the
chill of a winter evening striking through fur
and leather as if their clothes had been slit and
punctured in half a dozen places.</p>

<p>Mottin had just slid back in his seat after
a sweeping search of the sea through his
glasses, and was slowly winding, with cold
fur-gloved fingers, the neat carriage clock on
the sloping board before him, when he heard
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
a yelping war-cry from the pilot and felt
the machine dive steeply and swerve to port.
He half rose in his seat and then slipped back
to feel for his bomb-levers. The submarine
was just breaking surface eight hundred feet
below and a mile ahead. As he looked she
tucked down her bow and slipped under again,
having barely shown her conning-tower clear
of the short choppy waves. The pilot throttled
well down and glided over the smooth, ringed
spot which marked where she had vanished.
As it slid past below them he opened up his
engines again and "zoomed" back to his height.
He turned his head to look at Mottin, but
said nothing. Mottin made a circular motion
with his hand and they began a wide sweep
round, climbing all the while. Mottin sat back
and thought hard. No, it had not been indecision
that had prevented him from dropping
bombs then. He knew it was not that, but
the exact reasons which had flashed through
his mind at the fateful moment must be hunted
out and marshalled again. He knew that his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
second self, his wide-awake and infallible substitute
who took over command of his body in
moments of emergency, had thought it all out
in a flash and had arrived at his decision for
sound reasons. Yes, it was clear now, but that
confounded fighting substitute of his was just
a bit cold-blooded, he thought. They had
petrol for the run home with perhaps half an
hour to spare. Fritz had not seen them, as
his lid had not opened&mdash;or at any rate if he
had seen them through his periscope, the fact
of no bomb having been dropped would encourage
him to think that the seaplane had
passed on unknowing. Of course they might
have let go bombs, but, well, Fritz must have
been at anything down to 80 feet at the
moment they passed over him, and it was
chancy shooting. Yes, it was quite clear.
Fritz should be up again in an hour (he evidently
wanted to come up), and if they were
only high up and ready they would get a fair
chance at him. Of course, they would not get
home if they waited an hour; but if that cold-blooded
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
second self of his thought it the right
thing and a proper chance to take, well, it was
so. Mottin looked over the side and wished
it was not so loppy. A long easy swell was
nothing, but this short choppy sea was going
to be the devil. The pilot shouted something
to him and pointed at the clock and the big
petrol tank overhead. Mottin nodded comprehension,
and shouted back. The Sub took a
careful look overside and studied the water a
moment. Then he laughed back at Mottin, and
shouted something about bathing, which was
presumably facetious, but which was lost in
the recesses of the headpieces.</p>

<p>The sun was down on the horizon, and the
hour had grown to a full ninety minutes before
the chance came. They had not worried about
clocks or thoughts of petrol after the first half-hour
of circling. They were "for it," anyhow,
after that, and it was going to come in the
dark too, so that the question of whether it
was going to be fifty or a hundred miles from
land did not make much difference. Almost
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
directly below them the long grey hull rose
and grew clear, the splashing waves making a
wide area of white water show on each side
of her. The seaplane's engines stopped with
startling suddenness, and to the sound of a
rushing wind in the wires and of ticking,
swishing propellers they began a two-thousand-feet
spiral glide, coming from as nearly overhead
as the turning circle of the big machine
would allow. At two hundred feet the pilot
eased his rudder and began a wider turn, and
then the German captain saw. He leapt for
the conning-tower, leaving a startled look-out
man behind. The man tried to follow him
down, but the lid slammed before he could
arrive at it. He turned and looked helplessly
at the big planes and body rushing down a
hundred yards astern. With his hands half
raised and shoulders hunched up the poor devil
met his death, two huge bombs "straddling"
the conning-tower and bursting fairly on the
hull as the boat started under. Mottin had a
vision of a glare of light from the rent hull,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
a great rush of foaming, spouting air, and
then a graceful knife-edge stem, with the bulge
of torpedo-tubes on each side of it, just showed
and vanished in the turmoil of broken water.
The seaplane roared up again, heading west,
the young pilot&mdash;apparently oblivious to the
fact that he hardly expected to be alive till
morning&mdash;displaying his feelings on the subject
of his late enemy by a series of violent
"switchbacks."</p>

<p>Mottin checked him, rose, and began a careful
look round. Any ship would be welcome
now, neutral or not; but this was an unfrequented
area to hope to be picked up in.
The petrol might last five minutes or half an
hour&mdash;one could not be certain. The gauge
was hardly accurate enough in this old bus to
work by. As he looked the engines gave a
premonitory splutter and then picked up again.
Well, it was five minutes, he reflected, not half
an hour&mdash;that was all. The pilot turned and
headed up wind. With the engines missing
more and more frequently they glided down,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
making a perfect landing of the "intentional
pancake" order on the crest of a white-topped
four-foot wave. Instantly they began to feel
the seas&mdash;the hard, rough, senseless water that
was so different to the air they had come from.
The machine made wicked weather of it, and
it was obvious that she could hardly last long.
She lurched and rocked viciously, constraining
them to cling to the sides of the frail body.
Mottin pulled off his headpiece, and the pilot
followed suit.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mottin, "it was worth it&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"By gum, yes! It was that, and I give you
full numbers, sir. I thought for a moment you
had taken too long a chance, but you were right."</p>

<p>A wave splashed heavily over the speaker
and laid three inches of water in a pool around
his ankles.</p>

<p>"This is going to be a short business, sir,
unless we get busy."</p>

<p>"I know," said Mottin. "Case of four anchors
and wish for the day. Sea anchor indicated,
and mighty quick too."...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
    An hour later it was pitch-dark, and a semi-waterlogged
seaplane drifted south, head to
sea, bucketing her nose into the lop. Two
figures crouched together in the body of her,
baling mechanically. On the upper plane an
electric torch glowed brightly, pointing westward.
The figures exchanged disjointed sentences as
they baled, and occasionally one of them would
stretch his head up for a glance round for
possible passing lights.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Sub!" said Mottin. "Your teeth
are chattering like the deuce. Bale harder and
get warm."</p>

<p>"It's not the cold, it's the weather that's doing
me in, sir. I'm so damned sea-sick."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a filthy motion, but she's steadier
than she was. 'Fraid she's sinking."</p>

<p>The Sub-Lieutenant ceased baling for a moment
and looked into his senior's face, dimly lit by
the reflection from the torch overhead. "Do
you know, sir," he said, "I don't feel as bucked
as I did? I believe I've got half-way to cold
feet about the show."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
    "Do you know, Sub"&mdash;Mottin copied the
hesitating voice&mdash;"I've had cold feet the whole
blinkin' time? If it wasn't for one thing I
keep thinking of, I'd be properly howling
about it."</p>

<p>"And what's that, sir?"</p>

<p>"D'you remember a line of Kipling's in that
'Widow of sleepy Chester' poem? It's about
'Fifty file of Burmans to open him Heaven's
gate.' Well, that's keeping me cheered up."</p>

<p>"'Mm&mdash;that's true. How many do you think
that boat carried?"</p>

<p>"Round about forty&mdash;she was a big packet."</p>

<p>"Only twenty file&mdash;still, that's good enough.
Besides, they'd have done damage to-morrow if
we hadn't got them."</p>

<p>"True for you, Sub&mdash;and they might have
killed women on that trip. Now they won't get
the chance."</p>

<p>"Twenty file. Ugh! I'll make 'em salute
when I see them. Hullo! See that, sir?" The
two men rose to their knees and stared out to
the west. A bright glow showed beyond the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
horizon, and through it ran a flicker of pulsating
flashes of vivid orange light. The glow broke
out again a point to the northward, and the unmistakable
beam of a searchlight swung to the
clouds and down again. As they looked, the
glow spread, and the rippling flashes as gun
answered gun came into view over their horizon.
Mottin fumbled for the glasses, but found them
wet through and useless. The action was evidently
coming their way, and was growing into
a pyrotechnic display such as few are fortunate
enough to see.</p>

<p>"Destroyers&mdash;coming right over us&mdash;Very's
pistol, quick! We may get a chance here. Don't
let the cartridges get wet, man&mdash;put 'em in your
coat." The guns began to bark clearly above
the straining and bumping noise of the crumbling
seaplane, and a wildly-aimed shell burst on the
water half a mile to windward. Both men were
standing up now, staring at the extraordinary
scene. A flotilla of destroyers passed each side
of them, one leading the other by nearly a mile.
The searchlights and gun-flashes lit the sea
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
between the opposing lines, and the vicious shells
sent columns of shining water up around the
rapt spectators, or whipped overhead in a continued
stuttering shriek.</p>

<p>A big destroyer passed at half a cable's length
in a quivering halo of light of her own making.
The short choppy beam sea sent a steady sheet
of spray across her forecastle, a sheet that showed
red in the light of the guns. As she passed the
Sub-Lieutenant raised his hand above his head,
and a Very's light sailed up into the air, showing
every detail of the battered seaplane with startling
clearness for a few seconds. A searchlight
whirled round from the destroyer, steadied blindingly
on their faces a moment, and was switched
off on the instant. As swiftly as it had approached,
the fight flickered away to the eastward,
till the last gleam was out of sight, and
the two wet and aching men crouched back
into the slopping water to continue their baling.</p>

<p>"If they <i>do</i> find us, it'll be rather luck, sir,"
said the younger man. "She isn't going to
last much longer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
    "Long enough, I reckon. But they may go
donkey's miles in a running fight like that. Is
that petrol tank free?"</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>"Yes, I couldn't get the union-nut off&mdash;it was
burred; so I broke the pipe and bent it back
on itself. It'll hold all right, I think&mdash;at least
it will only leak slowly. Hullo, she's going, sir."</p>

<p>"Not quite. Pass that tank aft and we'll
crawl out on the tail. That'll be the last bit
under, and we may as well use her all we can."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>With gasps and strainings they half-lifted,
half-floated the big tank along till they had
it jammed on end between the rudder and the
control-wires. They straddled the sloping tail,
crouching low to avoid the smack of the breaking
seas, their legs trailing in the icy water.
With frozen fingers the Sub-Lieutenant removed
two Very's cartridges from his breast-pocket and
tucked them inside his leather waistcoat.</p>

<p>A flurry of snow came down wind. The
two were too wet already to notice it, but as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
it grew heavier the increased darkness made
Mottin lift his head and look round. At that
moment a gleam of brightness showed through
to windward; as he looked it faded and
vanished. He leaned aft and shouted weakly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come on, man&mdash;wake up! Fire another
one. They're here!"</p>

<p>It seemed an age to him before the pistol
was loaded, and his heart sank as a dull click
indicated an unmistakable misfire. He watched
the last cartridge inserted with dispassionate
interest. If one was wet, the other was almost
certain to be, and&mdash;Bang! The coloured ball
of fire soared up into the driving snow, and
the pistol slipped from the startled Sub-Lieutenant's
hand and shot overboard. The
searchlight came on again and grew stronger
and nearer, and as the glare of it became
intolerable, a tall black bow came dipping
and swaying past at a few yards' range.
Mottin almost let his will-power go at that
point&mdash;the relief was too great. He had a
confused memory afterwards of crashing wood
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
as the tailplane ground against a steel side,
and of barking his shins as he was hauled
across a wire guard-rail and dropped on a
very nubbly deck. The wardroom seemed
a blaze of intense light after the darkness
outside, and the temporary surgeon who took
charge of him the most sensible and charming
person in the Service.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>"Sit down&mdash;take your coat off&mdash;lap this
down. That's right. Now, I have two duties
in this ship&mdash;I'm doctor and I'm the wine
caterer. They are not incompatible. You will
therefore go to bed now in the Captain's cabin,
and you'll have a hot toddy as soon as you're
there; come along now and get your clothes
off. Your mate is in the First Lieutenant's
cabin, and he won't wake up till morning."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Mottin, from beneath
a pile of blankets, heard a tinkle of curtain
rings and looked out. A muffled, snow-covered
figure entered quietly and began to peel off
a lammy coat. Mottin coughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
    "Hullo! How are you feeling? I've just
come for a change of clothes. I won't be long&mdash;I'm
Sangatte. No, that's all right. I won't
be turning in to-night; we're going right up
harbour, and I'll be busy till daylight."</p>

<p>He bustled round the chest of drawers,
pulling out woollen scarves, stockings, &amp;c., and
talking rapidly. "Lucky touch our finding
you. I noted position when your first light
went up, but as the chase looked like running
on ninety mile yet, I didn't expect to find you.
Your joss was in, because the snow came down
and they put up a smoke-screen and ceased
fire, so we lost touch, and I hadn't far to come
back to look for you. Got a Fritz, did you?
Good man! We'll have a bottle on your decoration
when we get in. The Huns? Yes, they
lost their rear ship right off, and the others
were plastered good and plenty. We lost
one on a mine, but we took the crew off
and sank her. I sank your 'plane just now&mdash;tied
a pig of ballast to her and chucked
it over. I thought you might have left some
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
papers&mdash;oh! you've got 'em, have you? That's
good."</p>

<p>"Yes, they're in my coat pocket. I say,
haven't I seen you before? I seem to remember
you. Do you hunt?" Mottin stretched his
legs out sleepily as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;met you with the Hambledon or
Cattistock, I expect. Haven't been on a horse
for all of three years, though; and I don't
suppose there'll be much doing that way for
a long time, now they're putting half the
country under plough. S'long. I'm for the
bridge; ring that bell if you want anything.
The Doc.'s got one or two wounded forrard, so
he'll be busy, but my servant'll look out for
you." The curtain clashed back, and Mottin,
turning over, slid instantly into a log-like sleep.</p>

<h2>AN AFFAIR OF OUTPOSTS.</h2>

<p>The wardroom of the Depôt ship was just
emptying as the late-breakfast party lit their
pipes and cigarettes and headed for the smoking-room
next door, when a signalman brought
the news in. The Commander, standing by the
radiator, took the pad from the man's hand
and read it aloud. He raised his voice for the
first few words, then continued in his usual
staccato tones as the silence of his audience
showed that they were straining their ears in
fear of missing a word:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>Lyddite</i>, <i>Prism</i>, <i>Axite</i>, and <i>Pebble</i> in action
last night with six enemy destroyers&mdash;<i>Pebble</i>
sunk&mdash;fifty-seven survivors aboard
<i>Lyddite</i>&mdash;enemy lost two sunk, possibly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
three&mdash;<i>Lyddite</i> with prisoners and <i>Prism</i>
with <i>Axite</i> in tow arriving forenoon
to-day."</p>
</div>

<p>There was a moment's pause as the Commander
handed the signal back, and then half
a dozen officers spoke at once. The Fleet-Surgeon
was not one of them. He gathered
up his two juniors with a significant glance, as
one sees a hostess signal to her Division as the
dessert-talk flags, and the three vanished through
the door to get to work on their grim preparations.
The Engineer officers conferred for a
minute in low tones and then followed them
out. The signal had given clearer data for
the workers in flesh and bone to act on than
it had for those who work in metals, and there
was nothing for the latter to do but to get their
men ready and to guess at probabilities. The
remainder of the Mess broke into a buzz of
conversation: "<i>Axite</i>, she must be pretty well
hashed up; it must have been gun-fire, a torpedo
would have sunk her.... Rot! why should it?
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
What about the <i>Salcombe</i> or the <i>Ventnor</i>? <i>They</i>
got home.... Yes, but not from so far out,
and there's a sea running outside too.... Well,
the Noorder Diep isn't a hundred miles, and that
must be where...."</p>

<p>The Commander beckoned the First Lieutenant
to him, as that officer was rising from his chair
at the writing-table. "You'd better warn the
Gunner, Borden, that the divers may be needed;
and tell my messenger as you go out that I want
to see the Boatswain and Carpenter too&mdash;thank
you." He turned to the ship's side and looked
out through the scuttle at the dancing, sunlit
waters of the harbour. He had supervised the
work of preparation for assisting and patching
lame ducks more than once before, and he knew
that his subordinates needed little assistance
from him. What was troubling his mind was
the question of the casualties. The <i>Pebble</i> was
gone, so there was no need for spare hands to
be provided for her, while her survivors were
actually a gain. They would not be fit for work
for a bit, though, a good few of them probably
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
wounded, and the remainder perhaps needing
treatment after immersion in a December sea.
Then the three others&mdash;it sounded like a hard-fought
action, and hard fights meant losses.
That was the worst of these destroyer actions,
the casualties were mostly good men, and it
took so long to train good ratings. If only
one saved the officers and men it wouldn't really
matter how many destroyers were lost, he reflected,
as he walked out of the mess towards
his cabin and the little group of Warrant and
Petty officers who awaited him by the doorway.</p>

<p>It was barely an hour later, and the bustle
of preparation aboard the Depôt ship was still
in progress when they came in sight. The
outer forts had reported them as approaching
the entrance, and the next news was good also,
for it was simply the deduction on the part of
the watching ships' companies, when they saw
the big black-and-yellow salvage tugs that had
been out since dawn come chugging up harbour
alone, that the victors had disdained assistance.
Then the <i>Lyddite</i> showed her high bow and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
unmistakable funnels as she swung round the
entrance shoals and steadied up harbour at a
leisurely ten knots. At that distance she looked
dirty and sea-worn, but intact. Close astern
of her came <i>Prism</i> and <i>Axite</i>, and as they
showed, the watchers involuntarily caught their
breaths.</p>

<p>The <i>Prism</i> looked queer and foreign somehow,
with no foremast, a bare skeleton of a bridge,
and a shapeless heap where the forward funnel
had stood. The <i>Axite</i> looked just what she was&mdash;a
mere battered hull, with very little standing
above the level of her deck, her stern nearly
awash, and her bow bent and torn as if some
giant hand had gripped and twisted it. As the
pair of cripples neared the dock entrance, two
smaller tugs which had followed astern came
hurrying up to close on the <i>Axite's</i> sides, while
the towing hawser that had been watched with
such anxiety through three cold and stormy
watches splashed in the churned-up water under
the <i>Prism's</i> counter. The <i>Prism</i> increased speed
slightly, and up against the blustering wind
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
came the faint sound of cheering from the
cruisers down the harbour as she passed them.
She eased down into station astern of the
<i>Lyddite</i>, and the Yeoman of Signals on the
Depôt ship's bridge shifted his telescope from
the shaking canvas of the wind-dodger to the
steadier support of a stanchion.</p>

<p>"What's she like&mdash;can you make 'er out?"
A Leading Telegraphist had walked out from
the wireless office, and, in obvious hopes of
getting hold of the telescope, was standing
at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Pretty sight, I don't think," replied the
Yeoman grimly. "Dirty work for the hospital
there, and I reckon it's 'Port Watch look for
messmates'&mdash;all along under the bridge she's
been catching it, and I can't see&mdash;Yes, O.K.&mdash;He's
up there on the bridge&mdash;<i>Who?</i> The skipper,
of course. Mister Calton, Commander&mdash;begging
his pardon. Me and him were in the old
<i>Cantaloup</i> two years. Gawd! but ain't they
been in a dust-up! What do you say?
<i>Lyddite?</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
    He turned to look as the big destroyer passed,
half-raised his glass, and then lowered it.
There was enough for his naked eye to see to
discourage him from a closer view. Her decks
were crowded with men, lying, standing, or
sitting down. The white bandages showed
up clearly against the general background of
dull grime, and the bandages were many. A
torpedo-tube pointing up like an A.A. gun, and
a dozen or so of splinter holes in funnel and
casing, showed that some, at least, of the
wounded were her own. About the casing,
between the wounded, lay dozens of dull brass
cartridge-cases, and aft&mdash;a curious touch of
triviality&mdash;two seamen and a steward were
emptying boxes of smashed glass and crockery
overside. A few men waved and shouted in
reply as the Depôt ship roared a welcome
across to her, but the greater number were
silent. The two scarred and blood-spotted
craft swung gently in to the jetty, where the
lines of ambulances and stretchers awaited
them, and as the first heaving-lines flew, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Yeoman turned to the Telegraphist with a look
almost of pride on his dark saturnine face&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I'm &mdash;&mdash;," he said admiringly, "if
that ain't swank! Did you see 'em? Why,
stiffen the Dutch&mdash;they've got new Sunday
Ensigns hoisted to come up harbour with, and"&mdash;he
swung round and levelled his glass at the
<i>Axite</i>, now almost hidden in the smoke and
steam of the group of tugs around her at the
lock gates&mdash;"I'm damned if she ain't got a
new one up too. Here, have a look at it, man.
It's on a boathook staff sticking up in the
muzzle of the high-angle gun&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<h2>1917.</h2>

<p>The "liaison officer" felt distinctly nervous as
his steamboat approached the gangway. He
had no qualms as to his capabilities of carrying
out the work he was detailed for&mdash;that of
acting as signals-and-operations-interpreter
aboard the Flotilla leader of a recently allied
destroyer division&mdash;but the fact that he had
been told that he must be prepared to be tactful
weighed heavily on his mind. His ideas on
the subject of Americans were somewhat hidebound,
but at the same time very vague.
Would they spring the statement on him that
they had "come over to win the War for you,"
or would they refer at once to their War of
Independence? Did the Yankees hate all
Britishers, or&mdash;&mdash; His boat bumped alongside
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the neat teak ladder, and he noted with a seaman's
appreciation the perfectly-formed coachwhipping
and Turks' Heads on the rails. A
moment later he was standing on a very clean
steel deck, gravely returning the salute of what
appeared to be a muster of all the officers in
the ship.</p>

<p>A tall commander took a pace forward.
"<i>Malcolm</i>," he said, "I'm Captain&mdash;glad to
meet you." The Englishman saluted, and they
shook hands. "My name's Jackson," he replied,
and turned as the American, taking his arm,
ran through a rapid introduction to the other
officers. Each of these repeated the formula,
accompanied by the quick bow and handshake.
Jackson followed suit as best he could, and
began to feel that on such formal occasions he
had the makings of a real <i>attaché</i> or diplomatist
in him.</p>

<p>A few minutes, and he found himself sitting
in a long-chair in a wardroom which might
have been a counterpart of his own, and
accepting a long cigar from the box handed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
him. "Did you have a good trip over?" he
ventured.</p>

<p>"We sure did, and saw nix&mdash;not even a
U-boat. Had a bit of a gale first day out,
but it blew off quick. But say, there wasn't
a German ship for three thousand miles. Don't
you ever see some about?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see&mdash;er&mdash;no. They only show
out now and then, and it's only for a few hours
when they do. Of course, there are plenty of
Fritzes, but they keep under most of the time&mdash;you
don't see them much."</p>

<p>"Well, we thought it real slow, didn't we,
Commander? We were just ripe for some gunplay,
but we never got a chance to pull."</p>

<p>Jackson looked across at the Commander and
smiled. "We felt that way for a long time,
sir. But now we just go on hoping and keeping
ready. We've had so many false alarms, you
see."</p>

<p>The Commander laughed. "That's one on
you, Benson," he said. "We won't get so
excited next time we see the Northern Lights."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
    There was a general shout of laughter, and
Jackson turned cold. This, he thought, was a
little early for him to start putting his foot in
it. The officer called Benson, however, did not
appear to be about to throw over the alliance
just yet. He walked to the sideboard, and
returned with a couple of lumps of sugar in his
hand. "Lootenant," he said gravely, "in the
absence of stimulants in the U.S. Navy, I can
only give you what we've got. We've no liquor
aboard, but we've sure got sugar."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Commander. "We're all on
the water-waggon here, whether we like the
ride or not."</p>

<p>Jackson sat up in his chair and shed his
official pose. He could, at any rate, talk without
reserve on Service subjects. "Well, sir,"
he said, "I'm not a teetotaller, but it doesn't
worry me to go teetotal if I've got to. I don't
worry about it if I'm in training for anything;
and the fact is&mdash;well, if there was a referendum,
or something of that sort, in the Navy as to
whether we were to be compulsory teetotallers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
or not, I believe the majority would vote for
'no drinks.' <i>I</i> would, anyway, and I'm what
you'd call an average drinker."</p>

<p>"They didn't ask us to vote any, but if they
had&mdash;in war-time&mdash;I guess we'd have voted the
same way. If you can't get it you don't want
it, and we've kind of got used to water now.
And so your name's Jackson? Any relation?"</p>

<p>Jackson's brain worked at high pressure.
This was a poser. Sir Henry Jackson? Stonewall?
How many noted Jacksons were there?
He played for safety and replied with a
negative.</p>

<p>"Ah, well! there's perhaps some connection
you don't know of," said the Commander
encouragingly. "Which part of England are
your folk from? Birmingham. Well, of course,
it's a big family.... My father knew him
well, and was with him through the Valley
Campaign."</p>

<p>Jackson sighed with relief. "You're from
Virginia then, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;I'm from Maryland. My father
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
joined the Army of Virginia two days before
Bull Run."</p>

<p>"Are you all Southerners here, then?"</p>

<p>"We're sure <i>not</i>," came a chorus of voices.
"Nix on Secesh ... John Brown's Body...."
Jackson developed nerves again. He felt as if
he had asked a Nationalist meeting to join him
in drinking confusion to the Pope. The company
did not seem disposed to let him off, however.</p>

<p>"Which do you think ought to have won,
Lootenant? You were neutral&mdash;let's hear it."</p>

<p>Jackson looked apologetically at the Commander.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I think the North <i>had</i> to win;
and" (he hurried on) "it's just as well she did,
because if she hadn't there wouldn't be any
U.S.A. now&mdash;only a lot of small states."</p>

<p>"That's so; but there need not have been
any war at all."</p>

<p>"There needn't, sir; but it made the U.S.A.
all the same. The big event of the Franco-Prussian
War wasn't the surrender at Sedan;
it was the crowning of the German Emperor
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
at Versailles. And in the Civil War&mdash;well, it
made one nation of the Americans in the same
way as the other did of the Germans."</p>

<p>"Well, Lootenant, if wars are just to make
nations into one, what was the good of our
wars with you?"</p>

<p>Jackson was getting over his self-consciousness,
and it was dawning on him that the
American Navy has a method of "drawing"
very similar to that in use in his own.</p>

<p>"They were a lot of use," he protested. "We
sent German troops against you, and you killed
lots of them."</p>

<p>There was a general laugh.</p>

<p>"Say, Jackson," came a voice, "this little old
country of yours isn't doing much with the
Germans now except kill them. Say, she's
great! You're doing all the work, and you've
kept on telling us you're doing nix. Your
papers just talk small, as if your Army was
only a Yale-Princetown football crowd, and you
were the coon and not the Big Stick of the
bunch that's in it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
    "Well, you see, we don't like talking about
ourselves except to just buck our own people up."</p>

<p>Jackson's tone as he said this was, I regret
to say, just what yours or mine would have
been. It could only be described as "smug."</p>

<p>"You sure don't. We like to say what we're
doing when we come from New York."</p>

<p>Jackson prepared for an effort of tact. "I
hear," he said, "you've got quite a lot of
troops across already."</p>

<p>They told him&mdash;and his eyes opened.</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>" he said. "And how many&mdash;&mdash;?"
He digested the answers for a moment, and
decided that his store of tact could be pigeon-holed
again for a while. "But what about&mdash;your
papers haven't&mdash;I don't call that talking
much. We still think you're just beginning."</p>

<p>"So we are,&mdash;we've hardly started. But our
papers were given the wise word, and they
don't talk war secrets."</p>

<p>Jackson readjusted his ideas slightly, and his
attitude deflated itself. The transportation of
the First Expeditionary Force had been talked
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of as a big thing, but this&mdash;and he had until
then heard no whisper of it.</p>

<p>"And the country?" he asked. "What about
all your pro-Germans and aliens?"</p>

<p>"They don't," came the answer. "What do
you think of Wilson now?" Jackson edged
away to cover again. "He's a very fine statesman,
and a much bigger man than we thought
him once."</p>

<p>"Same here; and he knows his America. He
waited and he waited, and all the time the
country was just getting more raw about the
Germans, and then when he was good and ready
he came in; and I guess now he's got the country
<i>solid</i>."</p>

<p>Jackson pondered this for a moment, studying
the clean-cut young faces&mdash;all of the universal
"Naval" stamp&mdash;around him.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said slowly, "that it
wouldn't have been better for us if we'd been
able to stop out a few months ourselves at first.
It would have made <i>us</i> more solid too. But we
simply had to come in at once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
    "You had; and if you hadn't, we'd have talked
at you some."</p>

<p>Jackson laughed. "What! 'Too proud to
fight,' and all that sort of thing? Yes, we'd
have deserved it too. I say, what a shame
Admiral Mahan died right at the beginning!
There's nobody to take his place and write this
war up."</p>

<p>"Yes, he'd have been over here first tap of the
gong. And he'd have seen it all for himself, and
given you Britishers and us lectures on the war
of 1812&mdash;and every other war too."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a great pity. He taught us what
sea-power was, and till then we hardly knew
we had it at all."</p>

<p>"Well, he taught you enough to get us busy
mailing you paper about the blockade last year."</p>

<p>Jackson grinned. "You couldn't say much.
You made all the precedents yourselves when
you blockaded the South in '61. We only had
to refer you to your own letters to get out of
the argument."</p>

<p>The First Lieutenant beckoned for the cigar
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
box again. "You knew too much diplomatic
work for us in those days. We were new to
that card game. But I'd sooner hear our talk
now than the sort of gentle breathing of your
folks when it comes to diplomacy."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Jackson. "We're getting
better. We'll have an autocracy, like you,
before the war's over, instead of the democracy
we've got now."</p>

<p>The circle settled down and waited. This
was evidently not an unarmed foe, in the
ancient Anglo-Saxon game.</p>

<p>"Amurrica's the only real democracy in the
universe," said an incautious voice. Two heads
turned towards the speaker, and several pairs
of eyes spoke volumes.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Jackson.
"America's a great country, but as you told
me just now, she's solid. That means she's
so keen on getting on with the work that she's
chosen a boss and told him to go ahead and
give his orders, and so long as he does his best
to get on with the work, the people aren't going
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
to quarrel with him. Now we are not really
solid, just because we're too much of a
democracy."</p>

<p>"Say, you wouldn't think that if you'd been
over and seen our last elections; but there's
sense in it, all the same. But Lloyd George&mdash;isn't
he the same sort of Big Stick over
here?"</p>

<p>"You read our political papers and see," said
Jackson. "Do you take much interest in
politics in your Navy?"</p>

<p>"Do we hell&mdash;does yours?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit, except to curse at them. Navies
are outside politics."</p>

<p>"Except the German's, and their army and
navy and politics are all the same thing; and
they'll all come down together, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's going to take some tough
scrapping to do it. Let's hope no one starts
fighting over the corpse when she's beaten."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you won't, and we won't.
We've both got all the land we can do with,
and if there are any colonies to hand out after,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
we won't mind who gets 'em so long as the
Kaiser doesn't. What we ought to do is to
join England in a policing act for the world,
and just keep them all from fighting."</p>

<p>"That'd be no good. The rest of them would
combine against us. It would only mean a
different Balance of Power."</p>

<p>"Oh! Now you're talking European. We
stand out of the old-world Balance."</p>

<p>"You can't now. You've got hitched up in
it, and you'll find you're tangled when you
want to get back."</p>

<p>"We sure won't. We'll pull out when this
round-up's over&mdash;you watch us."</p>

<p>The Commander glanced at his watch and
rose. "Dinner's at 'half-six,'" he said. "You'd
better let me show you the way to your room."</p>

<p>Jackson rose and followed him aft to the
spare cabin. "Here you are," said the American.
"Hope you'll be comfortable. The boys will
do their best to make your stay here real
home-like, and I hope you'll stay just as long
as you can."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
    "I sure will, sir," came the answer, in a voice
that was fast losing its English drawl; and
Jackson, alone with his thoughts, stared at the
door-curtain, and wondered why on earth it
should have been considered necessary to tell
him that a supply of tact would be useful to
him in his new job.</p>

<h2>CHANCES.</h2>

<p>The boxing-stage was raised a clear three and
a half feet above the deck, and the mat showed
glaringly white in the northern sunshine. The
corner-posts were padded and wound with many
layers of red and blue bunting. A glance round
showed a great amphitheatre of faces, rising tier
on tier up to the crouching figures of men on
the main-derrick, funnel-casings, and masts.
The spectators numbered, perhaps, close on three
thousand, and there was hardly a man among
them who had not qualified as a critic by
personal experience at the game. The last two
competitors had just left the ring in a storm of
hand-clapping, and the white-sweatered seconds
ceased their professional chatter and their basin-splashing
employment to jump up and place the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
chairs back against the corner-posts as the next
two officers entered.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cairnley of H.M. T.B.D. &mdash;&mdash; pulled
the loose sleeves of his monkey-jacket across
his chest and stretched out his legs as he sat
down in the Blue corner. He looked across at
his opponent, who was standing talking in a
low voice to a second. Yes, he was evidently
only just inside the middle-weight limit, and
he, Cairnley, must be giving away all of half
a stone. Still, that was half a stone less to carry
about the ring, and he felt really fit and well-trained.
An officer was standing in the ring,
with a paper in one hand, and the other raised
to call for silence.</p>

<p>"First round of the Officers' Middle-weights.
In the Red corner, Lieutenant Santon of
the&mdash;&mdash;, in the Blue corner, Lieutenant Cairnley
of the&mdash;&mdash;." He slipped under the ropes and
jumped down from the stage as the voice of the
timekeeper followed his own&mdash;"Seconds out!"
Cairnley felt the coat plucked from his shoulders,
and he stood up as his chair was drawn away.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
"<i>Clang!</i>" went the heavy gong, and he walked
forward with his right hand out and his eyes
on his opponent's chest, in the midst of a great
silence. As their gloves touched, Cairnley jumped
quickly to one side and began his invariable
habit of working round to his opponent's left
hand. He was not allowed much time for
"routine work." He had an impression of a
looming figure getting larger, a whirl of feinting,
and he was being rushed back across the
ring in a storm of punches. His habit of keeping
his chin down, shoulders up, and elbows
in, saved him. He felt a thrill of respect for
Santon's punch as his head rocked from heavy
hook-blows on either side, and then he was
inside his opponent's elbows, working his head
forward, and lowering his right for a body punch
before they struck the ropes. As he felt their
springing contact at his back, he stiffened up
and pushed his man away. The recoil of the
hemp assisted him, and Santon gave ground
a yard. Cairnley jumped at him, and, taking
an even chance, sent a straight right over,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
which landed cleanly on the mouth. His left
followed at once, but only touched lightly.
Santon gave ground again, and the lighter man
slid after him, sending a long left home to the
nose. Cairnley thrilled as it landed. This man
was strong, he felt, but not quick enough in
defence. He half-feinted with his right, and sent
his left out again. As the punch extended he
slightly lifted his chin, and the ring whirled
round him as he took a tremendous cross-counter
that came in over his elbow. He came forward
quickly to get to close quarters, but his opponent
had no intention of letting him. There was
a whirl of gloves and a sound of heavy, grunting
hitting, and Cairnley found himself on his hands
and knees, with a very groggy feeling in his
head, looking across at Santon's white knees
by the ropes at the far side of the ring. He
stretched his neck, took a long breath, and rose
shakily. He did not feel as shaky as he looked,
for he had been in the ring before, and knew that
a knock-down blow sometimes entraps the optimistic
giver of it into sudden defeat, but in this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
case he was engaged with a boxer who took no
chances. Santon approached quickly and began
rapid feinting just outside hitting distance.
Cairnley gave ground slightly and waited for
the rush. This chap had a wicked right, he
reflected, and he did not want to get caught
napping again. Then Santon was on him
slamming in lefts and rights, and working furiously
to get him into a corner. Cairnley stooped
and struggled to get in close. A muscular change
in the body a foot from his eyes gave him warning
of an approaching upper-cut, and he brought
his right glove in front of his face in time to
stop it. He felt Santon's left on the back of
his head, and instantly shifted feet and escaped
round his opponent's left side. As he shifted he
jerked a hard, short left punch into the mark, and
then repeated the blow. Santon broke away,
and received a perfectly-timed straight left on
the nose as the gong rang. There was a storm
of applause as the men went to their corners,
for Cairnley's recovery had been well guarded,
and his quick hitting at the end of the round
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
showed that he had not lost much speed. He
lay back in his chair while his seconds fussed
around him, and thought hard. That right cross-counter
of Santon's was certainly a beauty, so
much so that it must be his favourite punch.
Could he be absolutely certain of its being produced
if he gave it the same chance? Well, he
had to win this on a knock-out, or not at all.
He could not pick up all the points he had lost
in the first round with only two to go, so it was
a case of chancing it on his brains alone. Yes,
he would just check his idea once, and if that
proved that Santon would use the same punch
for the same lead, he would go all out on the
next. <i>Clang!</i> He rose and walked straight
forward to meet his man. At six-feet range he
jumped in and drove his left for the mark. It
did not land true, but it enabled him to close
and start a succession of furious body punches.
The two hammering, gasping white figures reeled
about the ring for half a minute, heads down and
arms working like pistons.</p>

<p>Cairnley knew that his man was too strong for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
him at that game, but for that round, brain and
not muscle was his guide, and he wanted Santon
to be warmed up and made to act by habit and
use. They locked in a clinch, and a moment later
broke clear at the word of the Referee&mdash;the first
he had spoken in that fight. For a second they
stood on guard swaying from side to side as they
waited for an opening. Then Cairnley leaped in
and sent out a full straight left. Even with his
chin tucked well down he felt the jar of the right
that slid again over his elbow, and striking full
on the cheek, made his head ring and his neck
ache. He stopped the left that followed, then
landed on the face with his own left and closed
again to hammer in short arm punches. He felt
as he did so that the work he was engaged on
must be done soon, as at this high-speed work he
would not have the strength for a hard punch for
long. Santon appeared to be a little inclined for
a rest, too, for it was he who clinched this time.
Cairnley rested limply against him and took a
long breath as the voice of the Referee called
them apart. He caught his breath again and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
called up all his reserve strength as they posed
at long range, then he jumped forward as before,
sent his left out three-quarters of the way, and
showed his chin clear of his chest. Without a
check in the movement his left dropped, his body
pivoted, and he sent a full "haymaker" right up
and across to the half-glimpsed head in front of
him. A bony right wrist glanced from the top
of his bent head, and at the same instant a jar,
from his right knuckles to his back, told him
that brains had beaten skill. He slipped aside,
his hands mechanically raised in defence, and
stumbled over Santon's falling body. As he
scrambled up to cross the ring he looked back,
and knew at once that not ten nor twenty
seconds would be enough for that limp figure
to recover in.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>II.</h3>

<p>"Yes, I've got leave now, and Cairnley's in
hospital; he had a couple of splinters in him,
and they packed him off, though he wanted to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
get leave and treat himself. The old packet's
got to be just about rebuilt from the deck up,
and he's certain to get a bigger one instead.
He's going to take me on with him,&mdash;good thing
for me,&mdash;as I'll be pretty young to be Number
One of one of the Alpha class ships. I tell you,
it was a devilish funny show, and all over in a
second. It came on absolute pea-soup at four
and we had only heard the guns in the action.
Never saw a thing. We had been out away
from the line four hours. Had nothing but
wireless touch to tell us they had got into a
mix-up. We went to stations at full speed
trying to close on them, and we'd hardly got
ready when the Hun showed up four hundred
yards off. My word! she was smart on it. She
was only a cruiser, but in the fog she showed up
like the <i>Von der Tann</i>, and she was going all
of twenty-four. She let fly at the moment we
saw her, and she spun round and charged right
off. We let go too as she fired, but her turning
to ram saved her. We turned too and bolted,
and she just cut every darned thing down from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the casing up. The mast went on the first salvo,
one funnel and most of the guns. The shooting
was just lovely, and if it hadn't been such close
range we'd have been shot down in one act. As
it was, they just shaved us clean as if we'd
gone full speed under a low-level bridge. At six
hundred yards we could only see her gun-flashes,
and we yanked round across her bow and opened
out. The skipper gave her five minutes and
then levelled up on the same course we had
been on before, and eased a bit to keep station
on her beam. We did a bit of clearing up and
he sent for me. He was on the bridge&mdash;which
had damn little left on it, bar him,&mdash;it was a
proper wreck&mdash;and told me to arrange hands
to shout orders to the engine-room if required,
as the telegraphs were gone. The wheel was
all right&mdash;or at least the gearing was,&mdash;the wheel
itself had only a bit of rim and two spokes on
it. He told me to get what fish we could fire
set for surface, and that he was going to go
for her again and fire at twenty-five yards. I
thought he was mad, but I went down and got
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
'em ready. (The gunner was killed.) I shouted
up to him when I had done, and had mustered
a tube's crew, and we whacked on full bat again
and began to close. You see we had crossed
her bow once, and Cairnley reckoned then that
she would have altered back to her original
course of East, so he had kept on her port beam
at about a mile, going the same speed. I did not
get what he was driving at till afterwards. At
the time I thought he was just going to do it
again, because he thought he ought to make
another effort. We saw her first this time as
we were closing on the opposite side, and the
skipper told them to poop off the bow gun, which
was all we had, to wake them up. They woke
up all right, and we got the same smack from
all along her side we'd had before. She was
just abaft our starboard beam going the same
course, and I was wondering what the deuce he'd
meant by telling me to train the tubes to port,
when we went hard a-port and came round all
heeled over and shaking. I just thought to
myself, Well, if the Hun keeps on and doesn't
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
try to ram, we're going to look damn silly, when
I saw her again and she <i>was</i> ramming. Her
guns did no good then,&mdash;the change was too
quick for any sights to be held on. He banged
away all right, and I believe he put more helm
on&mdash;but he couldn't get us. The skipper had
said twenty-five yards, but it looked to me like
<i>feet</i>. He was going all out, and so were we,
and I pulled off as his stem showed abreast
the tubes&mdash;all spray and grey paint&mdash;and those
fish hit him abaft the second funnel. Eh?
Well, perhaps it was a few yards, but it's the
closest I've seen to going alongside a gangway.
Well, that's all I knew about it for half an
hour. The bang put me out. Skipper said he
turned back and searched for her, but it was
so thick then he couldn't have found an island
except by mistake. We'd been hit below water
too and couldn't steam much. We got a tow
home. Good egg! Here's St Pancras, and there's
a flapper&mdash;thirty if she's a day&mdash;Good old
blinkin' London!"</p>

<h2>A LANDFALL.</h2>

<p>The dawn came very slowly&mdash;a faint glow in
the sky spreading until first the streaming forecastle
and then the dirty-yellow seas could be
seen. The destroyer was steaming slowly along
the coast with the wind just before the beam.
She made bad weather of it, lurching at extraordinary
angles from side to side, yawing from
two to four points off her course, and throwing
her stern up as each wave passed under her, until
the water spouted in the wake of her slowly-moving
propellers. The wind and the mist had
come together, and the visibility extended to
perhaps three or four foaming wave-crests away.
They knew within a dozen miles where they
were, but a dozen miles is too vague a reckoning
to make a mine-guarded harbour from, and her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
captain, with the greatest respect for the fact
that he was on a dead lee shore, and a most inhospitable
and rocky shore at that, was feeling
for the land with an order for "Hard-over" helm
running through his head. Occasionally he
ceased his staring out on the lee bow to look
back along the deck. The sight each time made
him frown and tighten his lips. The beam-sea
was sweeping across the ship regularly every
half-minute. The water shot across her 'midships
three feet deep, and foaming like a Highland
burn in spate. The squat funnels showed
through the turmoil of water and spray, streaked
diagonally upwards with crusted white salt,
through which showed patches of red funnel-scale;
from them came a steady roaring note&mdash;the
signal of suppressed power below them.
Battened-down as she was, he knew that the
hatches were not submarine ones; built as they
were on a foundation little thicker than cardboard,
they could not keep out such seas, and he
visualised the turmoil and discomfort there must
be beneath him on the flooded decks. He, personally,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
had not seen in what state she was
below, having been on the bridge for the last
nine hours, but he felt he would like to take a
look at his own cabin and see if his worst foreboding&mdash;a
foot of water washing to and fro
across a sodden carpet&mdash;was true.</p>

<p>He glanced at his wrist-watch, and then to the
east. Half-past seven and full daylight. Well,
he thought, it might as well be just dawning still
for all the light there was. Air and sea were
the same colour, a creamy dull white, and they
merged into one at a range of perhaps five
hundred yards. If only he could&mdash;he raised his
head sharply and turned to face out on the beam.
Bracing his feet and gripping the rail with wet-gloved
fingers he held his breath in an intensity
of listening concentration. Yes, it was clearer
that time, a faint high whine broad on the beam.
He walked, timing the roll so that he had no
need to clutch for support, to where the helmsman
crouched over a wildly swinging compass-card,
and gave an order. The destroyer came
bowing and dipping round till she met the full
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
drive of the sea ahead. With a roar and a crash
the water tumbled in over the forecastle, shaking
the bridge, and falling in tons over the ladders
on to the upper deck. The destroyer still turned,
shaking from end to end, until she had the sea on
the other bow. The telegraph reply-gongs rang
back the acknowledgment of an order, and easing
to barely steerage-way, the ship settled in her
new position&mdash;hove-to in the direction from which
she had come overnight. The faint sound he had
heard had seemed too distant for the captain
to be assured of his position, and until he could
hear it clearly and from fairly close he was not
going to risk taking a departure from it. He
knew that hove-to as she was the destroyer was
going to be driven closer in, and with a steep-to
shore he could allow her to accept the leeway for
some time. He moved across and stood on the
other side of the bridge, looking out to leeward,
his attitude less strained and anxious now, as the
ship was making fairly easy weather of it. The
motion, it is true, was far more uncomfortable.
She sidled, dived, and wallowed in a way that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
would have thrown a man unaccustomed to
T.B.D.'s completely off his feet; but far less
water was coming aboard, and the amount that
did so arrived on a bearing from which she was
better fitted to receive it. At the end of twenty
minutes the captain began to resume his rigid
attitude. There was something wrong somewhere.
Sounds came erratically through fog,
but this could not be counted on. He knew he
had made no mistake in the sound he had heard.
It was certainly the high note of the lighthouse,
and not a steamer's whistle. The low note
should have been heard in between the high ones,
but the fact of not having heard the low was
not surprising to him. One seldom heard both
notes in a fog. But this silent gap was a
nuisance, considering the rate at which they must
be closing the land. At half an hour from his
first hearing the sound he turned uphill to gain
the wheel again, but froze still as the voice of
the fog-horn came afresh, this time with no
possibility of doubt. A great thuttering roar
broke out, as it seemed, almost overhead, a deep
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
bass note that made the air quiver. The captain
jumped amidships and barked an order. The
wheel spun hard down and the telegraphs
whirred round, bringing the destroyer diving
and leaping back head to sea. Looking aft, the
captain had a glimpse of three pinnacle rocks
showing a moment in the trough between two
seas, and then the fog shut down over them
again, leaving only the regular deep roar of the
fog-signal, that grew gradually fainter astern.
Two points at a time he eased the ship round
till she was hove-to on the opposite tack, then
he called to another oilskinned figure that stood
swaying to the roll by the helmsman. "Will
you take her now?" he said; "I am going to
look for some breakfast. Hold her like this
half an hour, and then turn her down wind for
the run in. The tide's setting us well round the
point now. All right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I'll lay it off again on the chart
before I turn. That was a queer hole in the fog,
sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, quite a big blank. Glad it wasn't much
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
bigger. Still, we could see four cables under the
land, and the land's alright if you've got your
stern to it."</p>

<p>With a huge yawn of relief he stretched his
arms back and up, then started down the thin
iron ladder on his perilous trip to the inevitable
chaos and confusion of his cabin.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>
<h2>NIGHT ROUNDS.</h2>

<p>It was a dark night with no moon, while
only occasionally could a star be seen from
the leader's bridge. The next astern could be
made out by the bands of blue-white phosphorescence
that fell away from her bow, but
the rest of the line was quite invisible. The
flotilla slid along at a pace that to them was
only a jog-trot, but which would have been
considered rather too exciting for night work
by the big ships. The night was calm, with
hardly a breath of wind, while the <i>hush</i>&mdash;<i>hush</i>&mdash;<i>hush</i>
from the bow-waves seemed to accentuate
the silence and to increase the impression
the destroyers gave of game moving down on
a tiptoe of expectancy to the drinking-pool,
ready at a sight or sound to spring to a frenzy
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of either offensive or defensive speed. On the
leader's bridge men spoke in low tones, as if
afraid that they might be overheard by the
enemy&mdash;actually to enable them to listen better
to whatever sound the echoes from the sea might
carry. On bridges and at gun-stations look-outs
stared out around them at the night, and there
was no need for the officers to be anxious as
to whether their men kept good watch or slept.
The crews knew the rules of destroyer-war in
the Narrow Seas&mdash;that "The first one to see,
shoots; and the first one to hit, wins." It is
true that they did not always see first. There
were exceptions. Not so long before, they had
been seen at a range of perhaps half a mile by
an officer on the low unobtrusive conning-tower
of a submarine. This officer had instantly and
accurately smitten on the back of the head the
sailor who shared his watch, and had rapped
out one word "<i>Down!</i>" The sailor (evidently
quite accustomed to this procedure) had vanished
down the conning-tower like a falling stone, the
officer's boots chasing the man's hands down the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
ladder-rungs. The lid had clanked down and
locked just a few seconds before a little "plop"
of water closed over the swirling suction that
showed where a big patrol submarine had been.
The boat was English (that is to say, her Captain
was Scotch, and her First Lieutenant Canadian,
while the remainder of her officers and men
together could hardly have mustered half a
dozen men from the Home Counties), but she
had no intention of risking explanations at short
range with her own friends. She had been
warned of their coming, but she looked on it
as a piece of extraordinarily bad luck to have
been met with at visibility range on such a
dark night and to have been inconvenienced into
a matter of ninety feet in a hurry. But it is
known that submarines dive for almost everything
and swear at everybody.</p>

<p>As the flotilla moved on its way a portent
showed on the bow to landward. A faint red
glow began to light up the low clouds over the
Belgian frontier, and the bridge look-outs whispered
together as they watched it brighten. As
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
it grew clearer it showed to be not one light,
but a rapid-running succession of instantaneous
lights far inland. The white pencil of a searchlight
beam showed and swung to the zenith and
back&mdash;perhaps half-way between the watchers
and the flicker in the sky. Ten minutes later,
as the light drew farther aft, a faint murmur
of sound (that began as a mere suspicion, and
grew to be unmistakably but barely audible)
announced the origin of the glow.</p>

<p>On the leader's bridge the tall officer in the
overcoat spoke to the shorter one in the "lammy."
"That's a bit on the big side for a night raid&mdash;they
must be attacking round by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; there's something like what they
call 'drum-fire' going on. Wonder why they
put searchlights on for it, though?"</p>

<p>"Can't guess. They'll have 'em on on the
coast in a minute too, if I know them. Perhaps
when they hear guns inland they think it's airbombs
coming down. There they go! Two of
'em&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The searchlights came on together, and on such
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
a clear and dark night they seemed startlingly
close. They swept the heavens over and back,
steadied awhile pointing inland, and went out
again, leaving an even inkier blackness than
before, and setting the watchers blinking and
rubbing their dazzled eyes. Away to the south-east
the pulsating growl of the guns continued,
though the breadth and height of the glow in
the sky was gradually decreasing.</p>

<p>"There isn't any fighting on near the coast
now, sir. That must be away down in France.
If they'd only fire slow we'd be able to get a
sort of range by the flash."</p>

<p>"You'd have to hold your watch for some time,
then," said the taller officer. "I haven't the
inland geography well enough in my head to
say where it is, but that scrap's nearer seventy
than sixty miles from here. Good Lord! And
I suppose we'll read in the papers when we get
in that 'there was activity at some points.'"</p>

<p>"And from here it looks like Hell. What it
must be like close to&mdash;&mdash;! Wish we could run
up one of the canals and join in, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
    "You'd be too late if we could. It's dying out
now. Just as well, too; it keeps all the look-outs'
heads turned that way. How's the time?
All right, we'll turn now and try back."</p>

<p>The glow faded and passed, and left the
velvety dark as blank as before. The leader
swung round on a wide curve, and, as if held
by one long elastic hawser, the flotilla followed
in her gleaming wake. At the same cantering
speed as they had come, they started on the
long beat back of their bloodthirsty prowl,
at the moment when the Scotch submarine
officer turned over the watch to his Canadian
subordinate.</p>

<p>"I've sheered right out now, and they ought
to be clear of us all right, but keep your eyes
skinned for them and nip under if you see them
again. They're devilish quick on the salvoes
in this longitude, and 'pon my soul I don't blame
'em either."</p>

<h2>A MATTER OF ROUTINE.</h2>

<p>There was little or no wind, and only a gentle
swell from the south. The ships rose and fell
lazily as they steamed to the south-eastward,
while only occasionally a handful of light
spray fell across a sunlit forecastle, drying
almost as it fell. But if the air was still the
ships were certainly not so&mdash;as vast as a great
moving town, the Fleet was travelling at the
speed of a touring car. From the Flagship's
foretop the view was extraordinary. Destroyers
or light cruisers when pressed seem to be
slipping along with something always in hand
and with no apparent effort; a battleship, however,
seen under the same conditions, makes
one think of St Paul's Cathedral being towed
up the Thames; she carries a "bone in her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
teeth," and her bows seem to settle low and
her stern to rise. In this case the Grand Fleet
was hurrying&mdash;moving south-east at full speed,
because&mdash;well, they <i>might</i> just cut the enemy
off; but the Hun was canny, and knew exactly
the danger-limit in this game of "Prisoner's
base."</p>

<p>The visibility was good, and as far as the
eye could see the water was torn and streaked
with the wakes of ships&mdash;cruisers, destroyers,
battleships, and craft of every queer and imaginable
warlike use. The great mass of steel
hulls had one thing only in common&mdash;they
could steam, and could steam always with
something in hand above the "speed of the
Fleet." From the ships came a faint brown
haze of smoke that shimmered with heat and
made the horizon dance and flicker. From the
foretop, looking aft, it seemed incredible that
there could be any power existing which could
drive such a huge beamy hulk as the Flagship
was, and leave such a turmoil of torn and
flattened water astern. Battleships in a hurry
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
are certainly not stately; an elderly matron in
pursuit of a tram-car shows dignity compared to
any one of them. But if they looked flustered
and undignified, they carried a cargo which no
one could smile at. "<i>Battleships are mobile
gun-platforms.</i>" I forget who said that&mdash;probably
Admiral Mahan&mdash;but it is true; and
if these ships showed an ungraceful way
of moving, they certainly complied with the
definition of gun-platforms. The low-sloped
turrets all pointed the same way&mdash;out to the
starboard bow. The long tapering guns moved
up and down, following the horizon against
the roll, and sighing as they moved, as if the
hydraulic engines were weary of the long wait.
On the tops of the turrets the figures of officers
could be seen pacing to and fro across the
steel&mdash;checking now and then to stare at the
southern horizon. Somewhere out there beneath
the blazing sun were the scouts, and
beyond them&mdash;well, that question was one that
the scouts were there to answer. The smaller
ships in sight seemed like motor-cycle pacers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
escorting a long-distance foot-race. With their
sterns low and their bow-waves running back
close to the beautifully-shaped hulls, they gave
the impression of sauntering along at their
leisure and of looking impatiently over their
shoulders at the big heavy-weights astern of
them. A destroyer division suddenly heeled
and altered course like redshank, each ship
turning as the leader swung, and with a
fountain of spray at their sharp high stems
they cut through the intervals of a Battleship
division, swinging up again together to the
south-east course as they cleared. The watcher
in the top had seen the trick before, but familiarity
could not prevent his eyes from widening
a little as he saw the stem of his next astern
throw up a little cloud of spray as it met the
foaming V-wake that followed a few yards
from the leader's counter. He smiled as he
thought of an old picture in 'Punch' of a
crowd of small children urging and dragging
a huge policeman along to a scene of disturbance.
The darting, restless destroyers seemed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
like the small bloodthirsty boys&mdash;hurrying on
ahead to see the fun, and then back to wait
for the ponderous but willing upholder of the
law&mdash;anxious to miss nothing of the excitement.</p>

<p>The Fleet was running down to intercept,
and might be in action at any moment if the
luck held, but there was no signalling or outpouring
of instructions. There was just nothing
to be said. Everybody knew more or less
what the tactical situation was; all knew that
the enemy might be met with any time in the
next few hours, but in the turrets the guns'
crews proceeded with the all-important task
of getting outside as much dinner as they could
comfortably stow. The procedure of endeavouring
to meet the High Sea Fleet and of dealing
with it on sight had been rehearsed so often,
that the real thing, if it came, would call for
one signal only, and no more. Many prophets
have said that the increase of Science and
Applied Mechanics in the Navy would make
men into mere slaves of machines, and into
unthinking units. This is another theory which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
has been shown to be hopelessly wrong&mdash;certainly
so in the Navy, as in it both officers
and men are taught, and have to be taught,
far more of the reasons for and the object
aimed at in the Rules for Battle than ever
Nelson thought it necessary to communicate to
his subordinates in the last Great War. The
Prussian system may be good, but it produces
a bludgeon&mdash;ours produces the finest tempered
blade.</p>

<p>The sight from the foretop was a thing that
one would remember all one's life, and be
thankful not to have missed. The almost incalculable
value of the great mass of ships&mdash;the
whirl of figures conjured up by a rough
estimate of the collective horse-power and the
numbers of men present; the attempt and
failure to even count the actual ships in sight;
the vision of a scared and wondering neutral
tramp lying between the lines with engines
stopped as the great masses of grey-painted
steel went past her along the broad highroads
of churned water,&mdash;this was the Fleet at sea;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
and the known fact that it would wheel, close,
or spread at the word of one man, from the
ships that foamed along four hundred yards
away to those whose mastheads could only just
be seen above the horizon, made the wonder
all the greater. One thought of the thousands
of eyes looking south in the direction of the
big gun-muzzles, of the shells that the guns
held rammed close home to the rifling, and of
the thousands of brains that were turning
over and over the old question, "Is it to be
this time, or have they slipped in again?"...</p>

<h2>TWO CHILDREN.</h2>

<p>His age was possibly nineteen, and his general
appearance had decided the members of his last
gunroom mess in their choice of a nickname
for him. "Little Boy Blue," or "Boy" for short,
would probably stick to him throughout his
naval career. The name had certainly followed
him to his present appointment as "third hand"
of a destroyer, where the other sub-lieutenants
of the flotilla were not likely to allow him to
forget it. He would have made a perfect
model for a Burne-Jones angel. His mother
would have worded that comparison differently,
being under the impression that no angel could
hope to equal him: on his part, he always took
most filial care not to disillusion her on such
a point. At the moment, in the first flush
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
of glory induced by the fact that he had left
gunroom life for ever, and that his midshipman's
patches were things of the recent past,
he was making the most of a week's leave,
and making the most also of the opportunity
of cultivating the society of a home Attraction
whom the discerning eyes of his mother may
or may not have yet noticed. The Attraction
was aged sixteen, extremely pretty, and, as
is usual in such cases, extremely self-possessed.</p>

<p>The Boy, as he accompanied her along the
garden path, was not feeling self-possessed
at all. He had discovered from frequent experience
that the only position he could retain
with reference to the lady as she walked was,
as he would put it, "half a cable on the starboard
quarter." Knowing as he did that he
was being kept thus distant by intention, he
followed the broad lines of strategy which his
naval training had taught him, and acted in
a way which on such occasions is always right&mdash;that
is, he aroused doubt and curiosity in
the mind of his adversary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
    The lady, who&mdash;carrying a ball of string in
one hand and a bowl of peas in the other&mdash;had
walked in cool silence for at least fifty
yards, turned suddenly and spoke.</p>

<p>"I suppose this is the first time you've&mdash;&mdash;What
<i>are</i> you staring at?"</p>

<p>The Boy blushed at once. "I beg your
pardon," he murmured; "I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is my hair coming down?"</p>

<p>The Boy looked fixedly again at a large
black bow which, as he told me afterwards,
"held the bight of it up." "No-o," he said
slowly.</p>

<p>"Then don't stare at it, and don't lag behind.
What was I saying?"</p>

<p>"You asked me how long leave I'd got."</p>

<p>"I didn't&mdash;you've told me that, and anyhow
I've forgotten. I was going to ask you if
this is the first time you've done any war-work."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was out in the Straits till last
Thursday week, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly. I mean work like this,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
digging and doing without things, and helping,
and so on."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose it is. I haven't had time,
really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lady turned on him in righteous scorn.
"<i>Time</i>&mdash;oh, you're one of the worst I know.
Won't you <i>ever</i> take the war seriously? You
just look on it all as a joke, and you won't
make <i>any</i> sacrifices. Now come here&mdash;take
the other end of this string, and lay it out
till I tell you to stop."</p>

<p>The Boy meekly obeyed instructions. He
pegged the end of the string firmly down and
returned to the Attraction, who was engaged
in hunting out a hoe from among a litter of
horticultural implements that lay in a corner
of the garden wall. He stood watching her
for a moment, and with her eyes away
from him, his attitude altered slightly and
became almost proprietary, while his face
seemed to harden a shade and give an
inkling of the naval stamp that it would
develop later on. She looked round suddenly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and saw him again as a shy and awkward
youth.</p>

<p>"Have you done it?" she said. "All right,
you can really start doing some work now. I'm
going to make you dig a trench. <i>That's</i> the
best way to serve your country when you're
ashore and have the chance. And to think
you've never used a hoe before!"</p>

<p>The Boy scraped the hoe reflectively with the
toe of his boot. It did not seem to him politic
to mention the fact that vegetable gardens do
not usually grow either on the decks of battleships
or on the shell-beaten slopes of Gallipoli.
He made no attempt to follow the tortuous
wanderings of a feminine mind, but held on his
own course. "Are you going to help?" he said.</p>

<p>"No. You'd only loaf at the work if I did,
and I've got other things to do, too. Now, come
along and start, or you'll never get it finished
by to-night."</p>

<p>"I'm leaving to-morrow," said the Boy.</p>

<p>"So you've told me&mdash;heaps of times to-day.
But you must finish that trench before you go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
    The Boy nodded and walked away towards
the pegged-out end of the string. The lady,
without turning her head, walked back up the
path until she came to the grassy slope at its
end. Selecting a spot from which a view could
be obtained through the hedge of her oppressed
admirer, she sat down and carefully laid the
basin of peas on the bank beside her.</p>

<p>"He's rather a dear," she observed cautiously
to herself. "But he <i>is</i> such a child. 'Wonder
why boys are always so awfully young compared
to women?"</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The flotilla would have turned round for its
run back in another half-hour if the last destroyer
in the enemy's line had not shown a
faint funnel-glare for the fractional part of a
second. They were only a couple of miles from
the end of the "beat" when it showed, and considering
the poor visibility that accompanied
the frequent snow-showers, it was a piece of
happy luck that the glare was seen at all. Three
people on the leader's bridge saw it together;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
two of them gave a kind of muffled yelp, as foxhound
puppies would at sight of their first cub,
while the third gave an order on the instant.
The destroyer settled a little by the stern, her
course altered slightly, and she began really to
travel. For some hours she had been jogging
along at seventeen knots, but her speed now
began to rise in jumps of five knots at a time,
till in a few minutes she had become a mad
and quivering fabric of impatient steel. As she
gained her speed the snow began to pour down
again, blotting out the faint shadow that had
meant the bow of her next astern. The Captain
glanced aft once, and then continued his intent
gazing forward. He had passed a rough bearing
and the signal to chase to his subordinates astern,
and could do no more till he could get touch
again. He had no intention of easing his speed
to wait for clearer visibility. He knew too much
of flotilla war to let a chance of fighting go by
in that way. If he once got to the enemy, the
rest of his flotilla would steer to the sound of
the guns; and anyhow, he decided, if he did
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
have to fight single-handed, the worse the
visibility was and the greater the confusion and
doubt among the enemy, the better would be the
chances for him. The snow ahead cleared for a
minute to leave a long narrow lane between the
showers, and he saw the loom of the last ship
of the enemy's line. The German destroyer
seemed to fall back to him, as if she was stopped,
though in reality she was holding station on her
next ahead at a fair sixteen knots. With a
startling crash and a blaze of blinding light the
guns opened from along the leader's side&mdash;the
German guns waiting, surprised, for a full
minute before they replied. When they did
open fire, the duel had become too one-sided to
be called a fight at all. Between the crashes of
the guns, the clatter and ring of ejected cartridge-cases
could be heard but faintly, yet as the big
leader passed her battered opponent at barely
half a cable distance, through the din and savage
intensity of a yard-arm fight the quartermaster
stooped over his tiny wheel, oblivious to all
things but the clear quiet voice that conned the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
ship past and on to her next victim. The rear
destroyer of the enemy swung away, stopped,
and remained&mdash;a horrible illustration of the
maxim of naval warfare, which says that he
who is unready should never leave harbour.</p>

<p>At the head of the German line a man of
decision had acted swiftly. As the blaze of the
gun-fire broke out astern of him, and before the
first German gun had fired a round, he had swung
the leading division four points off its course.
As the British destroyer tore on up the line, he
swung inwards again and closed on her to engage
on her disengaged side. As a piece of tactics it
was pretty and well performed, but nothing can
be judged to perfection in war, and this evolution
was no exception to the rule. As he closed in on
the British leader, she started her broadside on
her second quarry,&mdash;an opponent better prepared
than her first,&mdash;and the snow-laden air quivered
to the shock of furiously worked guns. The
flashes lit the contending ships in rippling,
blinding light, and across the foaming waters
that the fighters left in their passage, the drifting
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
snow showed up like flying gold. At short
range the leading German division broke in
with a burst of rapid fire, and in his swift
glance towards this menace from his disengaged
side the British leader saw the flaw
in his enemy's harness. The last of the German
division was too far astern for safety in view
of the fact that the British ship was at the
moment fighting-mad. The German leader
had a glimpse of a high bow swinging round
towards him in the midst of salvoes of bursting
shell&mdash;then came an increased burst of
firing from down the line astern, followed by
a great crash and a dull booming explosion.
The gun-fire died down and stopped as the
guns' crews lost sight of their target, until
the scattered flotilla was running on in the
same darkness as had preceded the fight,
though in far different condition. The German
leader was not sure as to what had happened
to the first of his command to be attacked, but
he knew well what had come to the rear ship
of his own division. She had been blown
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
up in the shock of being rammed by the
English madman, and although she had probably
taken her slayer with her, she had left
an impression on the minds of the rest of the
flotilla on the subject of what odds an English
ship considered to be equal, that would take
some considerable drilling to eradicate. He
flashed out a signal to tell his unseen ships
to concentrate, and the signal, shaded as it
was, drew down a salvo of shell from half a
mile away on his quarter. At full speed he
tore on for home, realising a fact that he had
only suspected before&mdash;that the savage who
had attacked him had been but the forerunner
of a flotilla of unknown numbers and strength.
The crackling sound of battle&mdash;a battle at
a longer range now&mdash;passed on and died down
as the unheeding snow smothered both light
and sound. Both flotillas were occupied, and
in their occupation had no time to think of
what was left astern of them,&mdash;a shattered
German destroyer stopped, helpless, and an
easy prey for the returning British&mdash;a litter
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of lifebelts, corpses, and wreckage, that marked
the grave of the rammed ship&mdash;and a barely-floating
hulk, her stern and half her deck
only above water, that lay rolling to the
swell; a broken monument to a man who had
fought a good fight and gone to his death
with the sound of the trumpets of the Hall
of all Brave Men calling in his ears.</p>

<p>The Boy twisted the seaman's silk handkerchief
more tightly round his left wrist, and
drew another fold across his broken hand. He
snapped his orders out furiously, and men
hastened to obey them. He knew that his
after-gun was the only one above water, and
that the sloping island of the stern that formed
its support was not likely to retain buoyancy
long, but so long as there were survivors
clustered aft and dry ammunition with which
they might load, he was going to be ready
for fighting. To the luck that caused one
of his flotilla to lose touch in the chase and
blunder across him, he owed the fact that he
was ever able to fight again. She came tearing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
by down wind&mdash;threw the narrow beam
of a searchlight full on to him&mdash;and recognising
by that extraordinary nautical "eye
for a ship," which can see all when a landsman
could see nothing, that the sloping battered
wreck was the remnant of a ship of her own
class, turned on a wide sweep to investigate.
The Boy knew nothing of her nationality, and
cared less what her intentions were. In the
midst of a litter of ammunition, wounded men,
and half-drowned or frozen survivors, he
slammed shell at her from his sightless and
tilted gun till his store of dry cartridges
dwindled and failed him. His shooting was
execrable; he could hardly make out the dark
blotch that was his target as, astonished and
silent, she circled round him. Savage and
berserk, he fired till his last round was gone,
then drew his motley collection of ratings
around him, and with pistol, knife, and spanner
they waited for their chance to board.</p>

<p>A long black hull slid cautiously into view
and closed them, till up against the beating
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
snow and rising wind a voice roared out
through a megaphone a sentence which no
German could ever attempt to copy&mdash;"You
blank, blank, blank," it said, "are you all
something mad?"</p>

<p>The Boy stood up, and his wounded hand
just then began to hurt him very much. "No
sir," he called in reply. "I'm sorry, sir; I
made a mistake. We've got a lot of wounded
here."</p>

<p>The night seemed to turn suddenly very
cold, and he realised that at some moment
since the collision he must have been in the
water.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The Boy did not see her till he had left the
train and was half-way along the station
platform. Then she came forward from the
ticket-collector's barrier, and he discovered
with a start that not only was the sun shining,
but that the world was a very good place
to be alive in. He dropped his suit-case to
shake hands, and then hastily snatched it up
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
to forestall her attempt to carry it for him.
She turned and piloted him out of the station
to where an ancient "growler" waited, its
steed dozing in the sunshine. "I ordered this
old thing, as I thought you mightn't be strong
enough to walk, but you're not such an
invalid as I expected. The carrier is bringing
your luggage." The lady spoke, looking
him carefully over from under the shade of
her hat.</p>

<p>"Walk! Yes, of course I can. I'm not an
invalid. I&mdash;No, I mean&mdash;let's drive." He
slung his suit-case hastily in through the open
cab door.</p>

<p>The lady seemed to see nothing inconsistent
in his incoherencies. She may have possibly
followed his train of thought. She merely
nodded, and reached in for his suit-case, which
she swung easily upwards, to be received by
the driver and placed on the roof. She then
stepped in, and watched as the Boy cautiously
entered and took his station beside her. With
what seemed almost a yawn, the old horse
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
roused and began to work up to his travelling
pace, a possible five miles to the hour.</p>

<p>"Well, Boy," said the lady, "and what sort
of a time did they give you in hospital?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;quite decent, you know; but mighty
little to eat. I believe they put every one on
low diet as soon as they get there just to keep
them humble and quiet."</p>

<p>"Well, your mother's just dying to feed you up,
so you'll get awfully fat soon. How's the hand?"</p>

<p>The Boy stretched out his left arm and showed
a suspiciously inert-looking brown glove. "Only
three fingers gone and some bits missing. It's
stopped my golf all right, though."</p>

<p>"But you'll still be able to hunt and shoot
and you'll work up some sort of a golf handicap
again when you're used to it. What was the
battle like, Boy?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;just the usual sort of destroyer scrap.
We saw them first in our packet, and so we
got most of it. It was a good scrap, though."</p>

<p>"Will you be able to go to sea again, or will
they&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
    The Boy flushed and leaned back. "Of course
I will&mdash;I've got a hand and a half, and they
can't stick me in a shore job when I've got
that much." The lady put a hand swiftly out
and rested it on the padded brown glove. "Of
course they can't. Sorry, Boy. I never thought
they would, you know." The Boy instantly
brought his right hand across, and, catching
the sympathetic hand that lay on his glove,
kissed it with decision. He then leaned back
again to the musty padding of the cab, rather
shocked at his own temerity. The lady, however,
showed no signs of confusion at all.</p>

<p>"How long sick leave did they give you?
Do you have to go back to the hospital, or
do you just report at the Admiralty?"</p>

<p>"I don't know,&mdash;look here, when are we
going to be engaged?"</p>

<p>"When we're old enough, Boy&mdash;if you're good.
Are you going to be?"</p>

<p>"That's a bet," said the Boy firmly. "So
long as I know it's going to be all right, I'll
be awfully good. What are you going to do
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
with me on leave? I can't dig trenches for
peas now&mdash;at least, not properly."</p>

<p>"No; but if you took a little more interest
in the subject, you'd know that at this time
of year you can pick them. Now, here's your
house, and you're going in to see your mother,
and I'm going home; and you're not to laugh
at her if she cries, and&mdash;pay attention, Boy&mdash;there's
no need for you to wear that glove on
your hand; she isn't a baby any more than
I am."</p>

<h2>AN URGENT COURTSHIP.</h2>

<p class="center">[Written with a lot of assistance from a partner.]</p>

<p>The solitary figure in the R.N. Barracks
smoking-room rose, stretched himself, and
lounged across to a table to change his evening
paper for a later edition.</p>

<p>"Hullo! old sportsman. Where's everybody?"</p>

<p>The "sportsman"&mdash;a precise-looking surgeon
who wore a wound-stripe on his cuff&mdash;looked
round from the litter of newspapers he had
been turning over.</p>

<p>"Why, lumme! if it ain't James the Giant-Killer.
Here, waiter! Hi! Two sherry&mdash;quick!
What the deuce brings you here, James?"</p>

<p>"Just down from the North,&mdash;joining the
<i>Great Harry</i> to-morrow. Where's every one?
Is there an air-raid on, and were the cellars
too full for you, my hack-saw expert?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
    "They were not. They're damn near empty,
worse luck. But the Depôt Boxing is on to-night,
and I'd be there too, only it's my turn
for guard. It's no good your going now, you
old pug; they'll finish in half an hour, and it's
a mile away."</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, I'm tired, anyway. I want dinner
and then a bed. Of all filthy games, give me
a war-time train journey. I've found a cabin
here, and I found a bath, and I won't quarrel
with any one for an hour or two."</p>

<p>"Then, you may as well keep the cabin
while you've got it, because the <i>Great Harry</i>
is having her mountings altered, and won't
commission for a week yet."</p>

<p>James Rainer swivelled round in his chair
to take the sherry glass from the waiter.
"Here's luck, Doc. I thought she commissioned
to-morrow, though."</p>

<p>"Gun trials to-day, and the experts didn't
like her. Not much wrong, I believe, but she's
delayed a week. Here's long life and a&mdash;&mdash;"
The surgeon paused and put his glass down.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
James Rainer stared at him somewhat truculently.</p>

<p>"James, my boy, I was forgetting. Your
little flapper's here. Ah! I see you know all
about that."</p>

<p>"Doc.&mdash;you're an ass; I wasn't thinking of
that at all."</p>

<p>The surgeon leaned back in his arm-chair
and prepared to enjoy himself.</p>

<p>"Ah! James, me old friend&mdash;pot companion
of me youth! What a chicken-butcher you
are! If only you hadn't been so young; two
years ago, was it not? How the years do roll
on, to be sure. And what a little romance it
was&mdash;the blue-eyed flag-lieutenant and the
admiral's daughter&mdash;<i>always</i> the first two down
to breakfast. And we used to hear, too, in
the Yard, of the little expeditions when you
were detailed to take her back to school and&mdash;<i>No!</i>
hands off! Would you touch me with a
cheild in me arrms? Let me go and I'll tell
you all about her&mdash;and look out for my drink,
you great ruffian."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
    "Never mind your drink." James released
the surgeon's head from under his arm and sat
down again. "Is she down here?"</p>

<p>"She is, James&mdash;and she's a devilish pretty
girl now, too. If it wasn't that we're most of
us crocks here we'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A signalman entered and glanced inquiringly
round the room.</p>

<p>"Who is it for, signalman? Anybody
hurt?"</p>

<p>"No, sir." The man looked at his signal-pad
again. "Send despatch officer to Admiralty
House instantly."</p>

<p>"Help!" The surgeon turned to Rainer.
"There's only one available to-night, and he's
at the Boxing. It's probably only stuff to be
brought back here. What about&mdash;&mdash;? But I
forgot, you're tired, aren't you? They'd better
telephone."</p>

<p>Rainer picked up his cap. "I'm not supposed
to join till to-morrow night, and I'm going even
if it means another filthy railway journey.
'Night, Doc!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
    The door banged decisively, and the surgeon
chuckled at some deep jest of his own.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Woodcote grunted
ferociously as a knock sounded at his study
door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" he barked. "Who is it?"</p>

<p>He looked up to see a tall clean-shaven lieutenant
enter&mdash;a broad-shouldered athletic figure
with a heavy jaw and twinkling grey eyes.</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;Rainer, how are you, my boy? I was
expecting the despatch officer."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but as I was at a loose end at the
barracks I came myself. I'm joining the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The <i>Great Harry</i>&mdash;yes, so you are. Well,
it's a long time since I saw you. You must
come and dine with us before you sail. Now,
you'd better get off with these. I'm going to
send you in the car." He pressed a bell and a
seaman entered. "The big car at once, <i>and</i> the
headlights. Tell Thompson to hurry up."</p>

<p>"Please, sir, Thompson's hurt his wrist, sir.
Starting the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
    "<i>Confound</i> Thompson&mdash;he's always doing it.
<i>Why</i> does he do it? Eh? Eh? You can't tell
me? Tell Miss Ruth to get the other car round
at once, d'you hear?"</p>

<p>"Now, Rainer," said the Admiral, "here's
the despatch. Take it to Shortholme aerodrome,
and bring a receipt back, d'you hear? and keep
that girl of mine out of mischief. <i>Come</i> in!"</p>

<p>The door opened, and a slim leather-coated
figure appeared. Rainer tried to keep his eyes
on the Admiral, but failed dismally, his efforts
resulting in a distressing squint. His flapper
of two years ago was now a calm, self-possessed,
and extremely pretty girl, who, in her rôle of
amateur chauffeur, did not seem even to be aware
of his presence in the room.</p>

<p>"The car is ready, father," she said, and
vanished, leaving the startled Rainer gaping at
a vision of neat black gaiters beneath her short
skirt.</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better get on then," said the
Admiral. "But, by the way, tell Forrest&mdash;Wing-Commander
Forrest&mdash;to keep an eye on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
his machines. There are three German prisoners
loose near here&mdash;two pilots and a mechanic from
their Flying Corps. They may try and steal a
machine to get away on. Tell him to lock up
his hangars, or whatever he calls the things, and&mdash;all
right&mdash;get on&mdash;get on. What are you
waiting for?"</p>

<p>Rainer, nothing loath, took his dismissal. He
hurried across the hall, cramming the despatch,
in its stiff parchment envelope, into the inside
pocket of his overcoat as he went. The car was
standing purring at the door, a leakage of light
from the side-lamps shining on a demure little
face behind the screen, and showing him also
that the back near-side door was standing invitingly
open.</p>

<p>"You little darling," he thought, "as if you
didn't <i>know</i> what you are in for." He firmly
closed the back door, sat down in the vacant
front seat, and reached over to pull in a rug
from behind him. As he did so the clutch was
gently engaged and the car slid quietly down
the drive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
    "It's jolly nice your driving me like this,
Miss Woodcote," he said. "Do you drive many
despatch officers?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Mr Rainer; Thompson and I take
turns at it."</p>

<p>"Are you an official chauffeur, then?"</p>

<p>"I have been for some time now."</p>

<p>"Always here?"</p>

<p>"No, I was at Portsmouth a bit."</p>

<p>"Indeed? How far is it to Shortcombe?"</p>

<p>"About twenty miles, by this road."</p>

<p>"You didn't seem surprised to see me in your
father's study."</p>

<p>The car dodged round a tram and began a
louder purr as it felt the open road ahead.</p>

<p>"Well, Hickson told me you had come."</p>

<p>"Oh! he did, did he? Did Hickson tell you
anything else?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I don't think it's quite nice for an
officer to bribe a butler to write and tell him
things about his master's daughter."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned. Hickson is a scoundrel.
I told him he wasn't to."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
    "Well, he did tell. I made him. And I think
it was very wrong of you."</p>

<p>"But I'd always looked after you before, and
it's only natural I should like to hear you weren't
getting into trouble after my eagle eye had left
you."</p>

<p>"Never mind about eagle eyes. It was very
rude, and it mustn't go on."</p>

<p>"It won't. I promise you."</p>

<p>Miss Woodcote, a little piqued at such easy
acquiescence, drove in silence for a few minutes,
then, unable to restrain her curiosity, fell into
the trap.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to hear you say so. It was
a silly thing to do."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was, perhaps. But the necessity for
it has gone now, so I don't mind."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to marry you now you're
grown up, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you please stop talking nonsense?"</p>

<p>"Will you marry me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
    "Well, that's one proposal over. I think a
girl can't be very distant with a man who's
proposed to her, can she? It implies a certain
intimacy, so to speak...?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It means, you see, a secret shared together,
and that should...."</p>

<p>A stony silence.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;it's not the only secret we've
had together. There was the matter of the
fire in the kitchen, when we were making
toffee and upset the paraffin...."</p>

<p>Still silence.</p>

<p>"You know two years ago I was going to
marry you if I could, and I knew that you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did you know?"</p>

<p>"Well, you knew I'd never let you marry
any one else."</p>

<p>"Mr Rainer&mdash;will you please be quiet? I
don't want to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Damn," said Rainer, leaning back sulkily.</p>

<p>"And don't swear, please."</p>

<p>Rainer sat up again. "Haven't I got cause
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
for swearing? We've come ten miles and I
wanted to kiss you before we'd done twenty.
You're wasting time, you know."</p>

<p>"I don't want to kiss any one, and certainly
not you."</p>

<p>Rainer's confidence began to evaporate slightly.
This was not quite the flapper he had known.
He sighed heavily, and, leaning back again,
turned slightly away from her, wishing that
he had eyes in the back of his head.</p>

<p>Miss Woodcote, secure in the knowledge that
he was not so favoured by nature, had glanced
three times in his direction before the trouble
started. The car whirled round a corner, its
speed regulated more by the state of the
driver's temper than by good judgment, and
the headlights shone full on a heavy farm cart
which lay right across the road. There was
a grinding of brakes, a lurch and skid, and
Rainer had just time to throw a protecting
arm across Ruth as the collision occurred. The
screen went to pieces as the headlights went
out, and the frightened Rainer and the extremely
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
angry chauffeuse stared at each other
in the dim glow of the side-lamps.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt? Are you all right?
<i>Ruth</i>...."</p>

<p>"The <i>beasts</i>, the <i>beasts</i>. I've <i>never</i> hit anything
before. <i>Oh!</i> Just look at all the glass."</p>

<p>The tone of her voice reassured the trembling
lover beside her, and rising to his feet, he
began to shed his overcoat.</p>

<p>"Cheer up," he said. "There mayn't be as
much damage as you think. We'll have a
look at it. Hullo!"</p>

<p>Two dark figures showed by the near side
of the bonnet, and a harsh voice rasped out:
"Out of the car and put your hands up.
Quickly, now, or you'll get hurt."</p>

<p>Rainer obeyed part of the order with startling
alacrity. This was a straightforward and
simple problem to deal with compared with
the attempt to instil sense into an unreasonable,
albeit delightful, girl. His overcoat dropped
to the floor-boards and he landed on the road
at the same moment. Two to one in a bad
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
light was very fair odds, he felt, and he only
regretted that he had not got his gloves on,
as he foresaw broken knuckles for himself by
the morning.</p>

<p>He shuffled forward a few feet and went in
for his left-hand adversary. The left feint
was only a concession to orthodoxy, but the
right hook which followed it was delivered
with a grunt and twist that meant business.
He sprang back at once behind the side-lamp,
perfectly satisfied that the recipient of the blow
was going to be a sleeping partner for some
minutes at least. The second man came forward
a little doubtfully, swearing in excellent
German. Rainer heard a cry from Ruth
and turned half round. A third opponent had
appeared from behind the car, and a club or
heavy stick was whirling over his head. For
an instant Rainer hesitated, then tried to
jump in under the weapon. He felt as he
did so that it was too late, but he arrived
safely on his man's chest, clutching for the
upraised arm. The left hand seized something
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
it had not expected to find&mdash;a girl's hand in a
leather glove. The club-man roared with rage,
swung round and struck savagely behind him.
Rainer had a glimpse of a white face going
down, and a little moan of pain from the
ground sent him berserk. An arm came
around his throat from behind, and he knew
that what he had to do must be done quickly.
He tripped the club-man and hurled himself
sideways and back. The three figures, swaying
and straining together, struck the car and
came down. Rainer felt the arm round his
neck slip and change to a hand. The owner
of the hand instantly began to regret this, as
Rainer's teeth were not only in good condition
but had a grip like a bull-dog's. The club-man
began to scream, and not without reason.
To be held against a car-wheel by a twelve-stone
rough-and-tumble expert who doesn't
mind being killed if only he leaves his mark
on you, is a bad position for any man to be
in. Rainer's hands were on his throat, the
knuckles working and straining upwards for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
the carotids, and Rainer's legs were quietly
but surely engaged in breaking his left ankle.</p>

<p>Then the man with the prisoned hand began
to talk rapidly, and Rainer threw his reserve
strength into his hands. He knew what was
coming. His first opponent had awakened. He
felt the man behind him wriggle his body clear,
and then came a smashing concussion. With a
feeling of regret that he had not been allowed
another ten seconds' grip he sank into oblivion.</p>

<p>Two men rose from beside him and leaned
panting and gasping against the car. One of
them subsided and sat on the running board,
his breath rasping and tearing in his throat.
The man who had felt Rainer's punch dropped
the club, took off a side-lamp and made a hasty
examination of the front of the car. Returning,
he spoke in short abrupt sentences to the others,
and assisted the seated man to his feet with
a kick. The three stood and listened for a
moment, then broke through the hedge and
vanished into the night.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
    It seemed to Rainer in his dreams that his
ship was coaling. He could hear the crash
and rattle and roar of the winches, and there
was a gritty taste in his mouth as if he was
working in the collier's hold. He spat out a
mouthful of dust and lifted his head. No&mdash;they
weren't coaling. He was lying against a
very hard and nobbly car, and he had a devil
of a headache. He considered the situation a
moment, and then woke up suddenly with a
cold feeling of fear. He rose and steadied himself
by a wing, then looked round. Yes, there
she was, a few feet away, and at the sight of
her his strength came back. He knelt down
and lifted her shoulders. She moved a little
and moaned. With trembling fingers he felt
the top of her head and found that the cap
was gone, and that there was a suspiciously
sticky lump on her forehead. He felt for his
handkerchief, but remembered that it was in
his overcoat. Lifting the girl in his arms he
tottered to the car and sat down in the front
seat, while he searched the coat pockets. He
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
found the handkerchief, and noted, as a side-issue,
that the despatches were still there. Unscrewing
the filling cap of the petrol tank he
plunged the handkerchief in, but turned his
head at a voice at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Jim! What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Thank God! Ruth, lie still. I'm going to
put some petrol on your head."</p>

<p>"<i>Ooo!</i>" The lady had straightened up in
her seat. "My poor head&mdash;it does hurt. Jim!
if you put petrol on my head I'll <i>never</i> marry
you."</p>

<p>"But, darling&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't do it. Have you got the despatches?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I don't think they were after them.
Ruth, d'you know that chap would have brained
me if you hadn't tackled him?"</p>

<p>"Why did you kiss me just before I woke up?"</p>

<p>"I didn't. I swear I didn't."</p>

<p>"You did. I know you did."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;Ruth, were you angry?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think you might see if you can
move the car, or do something useful?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
    "Ruth, were you? Ruth, I say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jim, there's a car coming. All right, be
quick. That will do. <i>There</i>, you old brute&mdash;now
go and meet that car. Give me your
hanky."</p>

<p>Rainer reluctantly dodged round the farm
cart, holding a side-lamp in his hand. The
headache was forgotten, and the world seemed
a remarkably pleasant place in spite of bruises
and stiff joints. The car pulled up and a group
of figures came towards him. "Hullo," said
one, "what's all this?"</p>

<p>Rainer recognised the speaker. "That you
Deane?" he replied. "Three escaped Huns
have attacked us. They've gone now. I was
bringing despatches for the Wing-Commander,
but they didn't get them. Miss Woodcote's in
the car. She's smashed&mdash;the car, I mean&mdash;and
she's had a blow on the head from a club."</p>

<p>"Lord! Those are our men. They walked
out to one of our machines at dusk just after
it landed, but they ran when they were challenged.
We're after them now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
    "Well, they can't get far. One's groggy and
one's lame. What about Miss Woodcote? She'll
have to be sent home. She's got a nasty crack
on the head."</p>

<p>"We'll send her to Admiralty House in this
lorry. Give me the despatches and you go back
with her. I'm going to spread my men out and
hunt the fields. They must have been after your
car."</p>

<p>Rainer walked back as the air-mechanics
began to move the farm cart out of the road.
"Ruth," he said, "we're going back on this
lorry. I've handed the despatches over, and
I'm going to take you home."</p>

<p>"Only ten miles, Jim, and you expected forty,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I did, but I hoped to have kissed you all the
last twenty of them, you little angel."</p>

<p>"Well, Jim, it looks a very dark lorry, doesn't
it? But as for kissing me in the other car&mdash;&mdash;Well,
you may have decided on the last twenty
miles, but I had arranged for the last hundred
yards up the drive. Why? You silly old thing.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
I can't do two things properly at once, and I
made up my mind when we started I was not
going to be kissed when I was driving. Carry
me across carefully, Jim, dear. I'm feeling rather
fragile now...."</p>

<h2>GRIT.</h2>

<p>The Captain of H.M. T.B.D. <i>Upavon</i> was in
a bad humour. He had decided when he
left harbour that this patrol was going to be
an uninteresting one, as the area allotted to
him covered no traffic lane, and was therefore
unlikely to hold an enemy within its boundaries.
The dulness of a blank horizon had
continued to confirm him in his opinion since
the patrol began. He spoke from his arm-chair
as the First Lieutenant struggled into
his oilskins preparatory to going on deck for
the First Watch.</p>

<p>"I don't care what courses you steer so long
as you work along to the west'ard and keep
the alterations logged. Beat across in twelve-mile
tacks, and tell your relief to do the same.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
I'll be keeping the morning, and I'll turn
round and work east at six. Got it?"</p>

<p>The First Lieutenant intimated that he had
"got it," and, pulling his sou'wester well down
over his ears, passed out: he was none too
cheerful at the moment himself. The rain
had been beating down in heavy streams since
dusk, and the long oily swell that had been
with them since leaving harbour had, although
it had not wetted their rails, made the steady
rolling rather monotonous.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The big tramp steamer might have had a
fighting chance if it had not been for the
torpedo. It hit fairly abreast her bridge,
and two boats at the port-davits broke to
splinters above the explosion, while the wireless
instruments developed defects that would
have taken a week to cure. The Chief Mate
never saw the periscope. The explosion, and
the sight of a hard white line stretching away
to port at right angles to their course, were
impressed on his brain simultaneously. It
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
was a few seconds later when he rose shakily
to his feet and mechanically set the engine-room
telegraphs to "stop." As he did so, the
Captain arrived with a rush on the bridge
and released him from his post. He hurried
below to examine the damage, and to fight,
by every means possible to seamanship, the
great Atlantic waters that he knew must by
then be flooding nearly half the hold-space
of the ship. Ships have reached harbour with
worse damage than she had received, and she
might have added another name to the list
of tributes to good seamanship had not the
enemy risen astern of them to complete his
work. A shell hummed over them, skimming
the tilted deck from two thousand yards
away. The second shell arrived as the tramp's
stern-gun fired, and the steamer quivered to
a dull rumbling shock that told of a well-delayed
fuse and a raking shot.</p>

<p>The tramp's big propeller threshed along,
half out of water, as her Captain rang down
for speed with which to dodge and man&oelig;uvre;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
but the vicious shells came steadily home into
her, and it was a question only of whether
the straining bulkheads forward would go
before her stern was blown in. The stern-gun
could hardly be depressed enough to get a
clear view of its target, and Fritz knew it.
The Chief Mate reckoned that it was about
the twelfth shell that finished them. Following
its explosion, he heard a noise that told
him much,&mdash;a hissing, rushing sound of air
from beneath his feet&mdash;the sigh of flooding
holds.</p>

<p>There was little time, but they did what
they could. The gun's crew, wrestling with
a refractory cartridge-box lid, hardly seemed
to look up as the tramp sank, carrying them
down as so many British seamen have gone
down, intent only on the job in hand. In
five minutes' time the ocean was clear again
save for a half-dozen bobbing heads clustered
round a small white upturned boat.</p>

<p>The sea, that from the deck of the tramp
had seemed to be only a long gentle swell,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
now appeared tremendous and threatening.
With a cable's length between their smooth
crests the big hills came majestically on, giving
the numbed survivors glimpses of the empty
spaces of the sea at intervals before lowering
them back to the broad dark valleys between.
For a few minutes the men simply paddled
their feet in silence as they clung with unnecessary
strength to the life-lines, stem, and
stern-posts of the capsized boat; then the
Chief Mate called to two of them by name.
He gave the white-bearded, semi-conscious
figure he supported into their charge and
commenced diving, or rather ducking down,
under the gunwale. He was blue with cold
and weariness before he gained his object&mdash;a
heavy eighteen-foot ash oar. The other two
men came to his assistance, and between them
they succeeded in passing the oar-loom across
and under the boat, and in working it about
until it caught and held at the far side. It
took the Chief Mate a ghastly quarter of an
hour before he could climb to the swaying
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
keel, but once there he easily hauled the
lighter of his assistants up beside him. With
the other man steadying the loom in position,
they swung their weight back on the painter
clove-hitched to the bending blade. Time after
time the oar slipped and had to be replaced,
and on each failure the cramped workers
panted and shivered a while before patiently
setting to the task again. As they toiled, the
send of the swell worked the boat broadside
on, and suddenly as they threw back on the
line she came sharply over, throwing them
into the sea before they could clutch the
rising gunwale with their hands. Followed
an hour of heart-breaking baling with caps
and hands, and then one by one the six came
aboard&mdash;the old Captain, who in the face
of active work was recovering consciousness,
insisting on being at any rate one of the last
three to leave the water.</p>

<p>The Chief Mate collapsed at once across the
after-thwart. He had been working with the
strength of desperation, and the effort had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
been great. The others knelt or sat on the
thwarts, staring around them as they swung
periodically on the crests of the waves in
hungry desire for the sight of help. One man
faced aft and began swearing, cursing the
cold, the Germans, the war, and, in a curious
twist of recollection, the ship's cook, who had
died twenty minutes before, but who had done
so suffering under the accusation of having
stolen the swearer's sugar ration. The Captain
rose, steadying himself by a hand on the
gunwale: "Stop that swearing, you," he
said; "lay aft here and rummage these lockers.
You other hands, muster the gear in the boat
and clear away the raffle. Mr Johnson, you
and I will bail for an hour; the boat is
leaking, and we'll take the first spell. We
want warming, I think."</p>

<p>The Chief Mate raised his head from against
the thwart&mdash;"I can't bale, sir; let the men
do it. I'm done."</p>

<p>"Mr Johnson, I'm sixty-five years old and
I'm going to bale, and I'm captain of this ship."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
    The Chief Mate clawed himself up to a
kneeling position, and taking a sodden cap
from the stern-sheets set feebly to work. As
he went on he warmed a little, and the deadly
feeling of despair began to leave him. The
movements of men about him as they hunted
for missing masts and oars roused him at
length to an oath at a seaman who lurched
against him.</p>

<p>An hour later the dusk closed down, and
with two men baling wearily the boat rose
and fell to what was undoubtedly a threatening
sea, tugging and jerking at her sea anchor.
The other four crouched in the stern-sheets,
huddled together to find warmth beneath the
beating rain.</p>

<p>"If the sail wasn't gone, sir, would you 'ave
tried to make land?" A seaman spoke, his
cheek against the Chief Mate's serge sleeve.</p>

<p>"I would, Hanson; and if we had two sound
oars, I'd use those too," said the old Captain.
"But even like this, I'm not going to give in
or stop trying."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
    One of the balers dropped his cap and leaned
sideways across the stern-sheets. "Tell 'em
the truth, sir," he said. "I know, and both
you officers know. If we had sails and oars
too and a fair wind, we couldn't make land
under a week. We'll not live three days in
this cold and on this ration, and there's no
traffic here. For Gawd's sake stop shammin',
an' let's take our medicine quiet."</p>

<p>The Chief Mate swore and started to rise,
but the Captain checked him. "One moment,
Mr Johnson," he said, and turned to the
ex-baler: "Listen now, my lad; it's not that
you're afraid, it's just that you haven't got
guts, that's your trouble. I'm an old man
and I've got to die soon anyhow, so it oughtn't
to matter to me. But I tell <i>you</i> that I'm
going to work till I freeze stiff on this job,
and I'll never stop trying if every one of you
does. It's true, there isn't much chance for
us, but there <i>is</i> a chance, and I won't let go
of it. If we were told to come this route,
it means some one else may be told to use it.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
There may be a ship just over the horizon
now. I tell you, I don't want some one to
pick me up drifting about and say, 'They
haven't been dead an hour yet; if they'd used
a bit more pluck they'd have pulled through.
No, by God, the man that sank my ship thinks
he's finished me, but as long as I can lift a
hand I'll try to beat him. I'll sail ships yet
in his dirty German teeth, and I'll take you
with me in my fo'c'sle. Now get on and bale
till your watch is up."</p>

<p>The man reached forward to the floating
cap and without a word continued to use it,
ladling the icy water overside in pitifully
small quantities. The white-bearded captain
subsided again beside the Chief Mate.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The <i>Upavon</i> was still rolling heavily as her
Captain came on the bridge for the morning
watch. She rolled a little uneasily now, and
there was a suspicion of a "top" to the seas
as they lifted her. The Captain glowered at
the crescent moon&mdash;having lost none of his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
ill-humour in the night,&mdash;while the Sub-Lieutenant
nervously turned over the watch to him.</p>

<p>"And we're to turn east at six, and the
First Lieutenant said to be careful to log all
alterations&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Captain dismissed him abruptly and
turned away. As if he didn't know his own
orders! Nice thing to be told them by a
young cub like that! He would alter round
just when he liked, of course. Damn the
rain! He'd alter course now and run down
before the wind. If those young beggars
thought he was going to spend the next two
hours facing the rain, they were very much
mistaken. Why, when he'd been their age
he'd faced more rain than they were ever
likely to meet, so&mdash;he spoke an order, and
the ship came slowly round through ten points
of the compass.</p>

<p>"Steady, now. How's her head? South?
All right; put that in the log&mdash;time, four-twenty...."</p>

<p>It was six-thirty, and the dawn and two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
cups of cocoa had removed a good deal of the
Captain's temper. He lit a cigarette and faced
to windward to look at the coming weather.</p>

<p>"M'm," he soliloquised; "and it's going to
breeze up a bit too. There'll be some breaking
seas by noon."</p>

<p>As he was turning to continue his pacing
of the bridge, he started and fumbled for his
binoculars. He stared a while to windward,
and then, without lowering the glasses, spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>"Starboard fifteen, quartermaster.... Steady,
now.... Steer for that white boat on the
port bow,&mdash;see it?... <i>Messenger!</i> go down
and tell the First Lieutenant I want him; and
call the surgeon, too."</p>

<h2>FROM A FAR COUNTRY.</h2>

<p>Announced by the jangling of the curtain that
he had almost brought down with his heavy
suit-case, a cheerful curly-haired officer entered
noisily and dropped into one of the Wardroom
arm-chairs. He stretched his legs out and,
lighting a cigarette, leaned back luxuriously.</p>

<p>"Well?" said a chorus of voices, "<i>well</i>&mdash;how's
London?"</p>

<p>The curly-haired one smiled reminiscently.
"Still standing, still standing," he replied. "No
place for you though, I'm afraid. You're none
of you good-looking enough to pass as Yanks or
Colonials."</p>

<p>"Oh, cut it out. Tell us what it's like. You
know, you're the first one to go there from us
for a year, and we want to know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
    "What? all about it? All right; chuck a
cup of tea across and I'll give you the special
correspondent's sob-stuff. <i>Aah!</i> that's better;
this train-travelling has given me a mouth like&mdash;I
won't say what. Well, I'll try and tell you
what I thought of it and the people that live
there. I may say at once that they are civilised
to the extent that they'll take English money
without complaining about it, and&mdash;<i>all</i> right,
I'll get on.</p>

<p>"Well, you know how I went off laden with
meat and other cards till I was bulging, and how
I reckoned to find people looking hungry at me
as if they were reckoning what I'd boil down to
in a stock-pot? Well, I've got all these cards
still&mdash;didn't need 'em. I'd usually left them in
my other coat when I got started on meals, and
as they've got the trick of camouflaging fish and
eggs till you don't know what you're eating, it
wasn't worth hunting 'em out. All London seems
to live on eggs, and where the deuce they all
come from I don't know; they must be using
up dumps of them. Oh, and another thing, I'd
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
forgotten that in London they don't grow electric
lighters on every bulkhead, and it was lucky
I had a few matches with me. The first day
I was stopped by fellers wanting a light off my
cigarette just three times in a dog-watch, but
the other days I didn't get asked at all&mdash;I'd
lost the country-cousin look, I s'pose. Men?
Yes, there's a fair sprinkling there still, but
nothing under forty, I should say. Yes, there
seem to be crowds of women. Perhaps there are
actually more, or it may be that the shortage
of men makes 'em look more; but there do seem
to be heaps of them. It just made me marvel,
too, at the extraordinary lack of imagination
the women have. They still wear devilish short
skirts, and yet there isn't one in forty of 'em
that has a foot and ankle that one could call
it decent to show. You'd think they'd see one
another's defects and get wise, but they don't.
I suppose that now the secret's out about their
legs, they reckon it's too late to hide the truth
and they face it out; but I'm surprised the
young ones don't camouflage themselves a bit
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
and get a fair start. Theatres? Yes; I went
through the list, revues and all. I read Arnold
Bennett's account of a music-hall&mdash;you know the
book? Yes, I read it in the train going down.
Well, I gathered from his description that things
had flashed up a bit since the dear dead days
of nineteen-sixteen, and that I would find myself
in a hall of dazzling Eastern et-ceteras; but, my
word! it was like tea at the Vicarage. I don't
know what revue Arnold Bennett found, but I
guess I missed it. It's true, I saw one perfectly
<i>reckless</i> lieutenant drop a programme out of a
box into the orchestra; but as the orchestra
didn't notice it, and I doubt if the lieutenant
did either, it could hardly be put down to riotous
conduct induced by drink and sensual music.
Oh, I noticed one thing&mdash;all the theatre programmes
had directions printed as to what to
do in case of air-raids during the performance.
They had it printed small and sandwiched in
between the <i>hats by Suzanne</i> and <i>dresses by Cox</i>
announcements. I liked that. It was British
and dignified. I'd like to have sent some copies
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
to Hindenburg. News? Yes, I heard a whole
lot, but it was mostly denied in the papers
next morning. It's a queer town for rumours.
I think they all live too close together, and
they get hysterical or something&mdash;like in that
Frenchman's book, you know, the 'Psychology
of Crowds,' or something like that. They weren't
worrying much about the war, though. I stopped
to look at the tape-messages in the club, and
there was an eight-line chit on the board mentioning
that the Hun was coming on like a gale
o' wind towards Paris, while the rest of the board
had eight full-length columns on the latest Old
Bailey case, and there was another column
coming through on the machine with a crowd
waiting for more. No, I'm <i>not</i> trying to be
cynical. I read 'em all, but I hadn't quite got
the London sense of proportion in two days,
and it worried me that there was no more war
news coming.</p>

<p>"Cost? Yes, <i>rather</i>. I've spent whole heaps
of bullion, and I'll have to ask the Pay for an
advance now. It's quite easy; you just exist
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
and the cash trickles off you. There's not so
much of the old 'men in uniform free' or 'half-price
to officers' going now. There aren't many
civilians left, and I guess <i>they're</i> just taking in
one another's washing. Everything that isn't
a necessity is double price at least, and I believe
the shopkeepers would like to make breathing
a luxury too. On the whole, I'm glad I only
had a few days there. The air's so foul, you
know. Mixture of scent and petrol, I think.
Oh but, by the way, I saw a hansom&mdash;a real
hansom&mdash;in Regent Street. Quite a neat well-kept
one, too. No, nothing new in the way of
dresses. Just the same as nineteen-sixteen, as
far as I could see. There may have been some
good-looking faces among the thousands in the
West-end streets, but they were cancelled by
the awful legs underneath. I wonder they ever
manage to get married. Well, I saw thousands
of that kind of female&mdash;more than one ever
saw before; but I met some others who squared
things up in my mind. Ten hours a day and
clean the car herself for one, and oxyacetyline
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
welding eight hours and overtime for another at
two-five a week. Doing it to win the War, and
not because they wanted to or liked it. Made
me feel small to be on leave when I talked to
'em. And then, as I was leaving the hotel, a
whole crowd of Swiss porters and servants, that
had been fairly coming the Field-Marshal over
me for three days, came oiling round me for
tips, and pocketed the cash without a word
when they got it; and&mdash;and&mdash;while they were
doing it, a Scotch corporal walked past the taxi
with three wound-stripes on his arm and four
notches on his bayonet hilt. It's all a bit too
puzzling for me. As soon as I got settled in
one impression, I'd get jolted out of it by
another. Heigho! I'm not sorry to have gone
there to look, and I'm not sorry to be back."
He rose, and moving across the Wardroom,
flung open the door of his tiny cabin and passed
in. His voice sounded hollow through the thin
partition. "Hi! outside there&mdash;some shaving
water <i>eck dum</i>," and then a contented murmur&mdash;"Lord!
but it's good to be home again."</p>

<h2>THE WAR OF ATTRITION.</h2>

<p>A wonderfully deep-blue sea stretched away
to meet a light-blue sky, which was dotted with
soft wool-like patches of cloud. There was a
slight smooth swell from the south-west, and
the air was cool and salt-laden. Looking from
the conning-tower the hull of the boat could be
clearly seen as she rose and fell to the waves,
the sunlight flashing back steel-blue from her
grey side six feet below the surface. It was a
day that showed the sea at its best&mdash;a high
Northern latitude in June, and a high barometer
producing conditions under which it seemed to
be a shame to be at war.</p>

<p>There were two men on the submarine's conning-tower.
The smaller of the two was her
captain, a fair-haired man with a Prussian
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
name which seemed hardly to fit in with his
Norse features. The other man hailed from
Bavaria&mdash;a tall, thin, large-headed individual,
with wide-set eyes and a nose and lower lip
that hinted of Semitic ancestry. The big
U-boat jogged along at half speed, beating up
and down in erratic courses&mdash;keeping always
to a water area of perhaps ten miles square.</p>

<p>The two officers leaned against a rail, their
heads and shoulders twisting and turning continuously
as they watched the distant horizon.
Each carried heavy Zeiss glasses slung round the
neck, and from time to time one of them would
search carefully the western sea and sky, his
doing so invariably infecting his companion
into doing the same. The U-boat was running
with a little less than half her normal cruising
buoyancy&mdash;for speed of diving and not surface
speed was the important qualification for her
for that day. From the open conning-tower lid
came the dull hum of the engines; while as the
boat rolled, a shaft of sunlight, shining down
the tower itself, sent a circle of yellow light
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
swinging slowly from side to side across the
deck beneath the eye-piece of the periscope.</p>

<p>"Is it a big convoy this time, sir?" The
First Lieutenant spoke without checking his
continual twisting and turning as he glanced at
every point of the skyline in turn.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a big convoy. But there is no
doubt of their course or their speed. We shall
be among them before the sunset."</p>

<p>"You would not then dive now? That is, if
you are sure&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not dive till I am sure. And also we
will want all the battery power we have before
the dark. Did I not say it was a big convoy?"</p>

<p>"You think there will be a big escort?"</p>

<p>"We will see. I know it will be an escort I
do not like to take a chance with."</p>

<p>The Lieutenant fidgeted awhile, his glasses at
his eyes. His Captain looked at his profile and
at the glint of perspiration on the slightly shaking
hands, and yawned. His face, as he swung
round again to scan the horizon astern, looked
bored and perhaps a little lonely. A submarine
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
is a small ship in which to coop up incompatible
natures, and the terrible losses of personnel in
the Imperial submarine service had sadly reduced
the standard of officers. He felt sometimes
as if he were an anachronism, an officer of
nineteen-fourteen who had miraculously lasted
four years. He felt that it had been only the
fact that a misdemeanour had caused him to be
driven forth to the big ships for two years that
had saved him from sharing the unknown fate
of his contemporaries. Well, he reflected, it was
only a matter of time before he would join them.
The law of averages was stronger than his luck,
wonderful though the latter had been. He extracted
a cigar from his case and reached out
a hand to take his subordinate's proffered matchbox.
As he did so he glanced again at his companion's
face, and a sudden feeling of understanding,
and perhaps a touch of compassion,
made him ask&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Müller? You have something that
worries you. What is it, then?"</p>

<p>The First Lieutenant turned and took a careful
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
glance round the circle of empty ocean. Then
his speech came with a rush&mdash;</p>

<p>"I want to know what you think, sir. You
don't seem to worry about it. I know you can
do nothing more&mdash;that one can only do one's
work as best one can and all that&mdash;but I still
feel restless. How is it going to end? We are
winning? Yes&mdash;oh yes, we are winning, but
we have done that four years, and how far have
we got? Before I came into submarines I believed
all they told us, but now I know that we
are not strangling England at sea, and that we
never can now. What are we going to do next?
Is it to go on and on until we have no boats left?
Gott! I want to do something that will frighten
them&mdash;something that will make them understand
what we are&mdash;something that will make
them scream for pity." He paused, gulped, and
stared again out to the westward. The Captain
straightened himself up against the rail and
stretched his arms out in another prodigious
yawn.</p>

<p>"My good Müller," he said, "you cannot carry
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
the cares of Germany on your back. Leave that
to the Chancellor. One can be sufficiently
patriotic by doing one's work and not asking
questions that others cannot answer. As to the
submarine war&mdash;well, blame the men who would
not let the Emperor have his way, that hindered
him when he would have built an equal fleet to
the English. I do not mean the Socialists&mdash;I
mean others as well. I mean men who grudged
money for the Navy because they wanted it for
the Army. Curse the Army! If we had had
a big fleet we would have won the war in a
year, but now&mdash;ach! Look now, Müller&mdash;you
have read Lichnowsky's Memoirs? Yes, I know
you are not allowed to, but I know you have.
Now I say that what he says at the end is
true,&mdash;that the Anglo-Saxon race is going to rule
the West and the sea, that we shall only rule
Middle Europe, and we were <i>fools</i> to play for
Middle Europe when we might have had the
sea. We would now give all the Russias and
Rumania and all our gains just for Gibraltar
and Bermuda, for if we had those stations all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
the rest would come to us. We fight now for
our honour, but if it were not for that&mdash;and that
is everything&mdash;we would give our enemies good
terms."</p>

<p>"But if that is true&mdash;if we can gain no more&mdash;we
have lost the war!"</p>

<p>The Captain shrugged. "We will have won
what we do not want, and lost all that we do;
but we shall have won, I suppose. It depends
on our diplomatists. If we can get but a few
coaling-stations we shall have won, for it would
all come to us when we were ready again. But
you will not gain a victory by a great stroke
as you say you wish, Müller. The war is too
big now for single strokes, and the English
will not scream for mercy now because of
frightfulness. They are angry, and they hate
us now."</p>

<p>"But you yourself have sunk a liner, and you
showed them as she sank that the orders of
Germany must be obeyed."</p>

<p>The Captain's face did not alter at all. "I did
do so, and I would do so again. My honour is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
clear, because I obeyed my orders. Would you
have dared to question?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;by God! and I would do it gladly."
The Lieutenant's face worked, and he scowled
as he glanced astern. "I would wish that every
ship of every convoy carried women."</p>

<p>The Captain laughed almost genially. "It is
easy to see you are not a Prussian," he said. "It
does not matter whether you like or dislike a
thing. All that counts is whether or not it is
to the advantage of the State. So the Roman
World-Empire was made. Myself, I doubt if
killing women pays us; there is this talk now
of the boycott of Germany after the war. They
add time to the boycott for every time we fire
on ships that are helpless, and the boycott is to
be by sailors. I would laugh at such a threat
if it was from any others, but sailors are not
to be laughed at. They are likely to mean what
they say. It is as I said: if we had fought to
the West and to the sea, no man would have
dared to threaten us with a sea-boycott now."</p>

<p>"But even with our small Navy we have held
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
the English checked. It is not our Navy that
is lacking. What is it, then?"</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> the Navy. It should have been as
big as the English Fleet. And the men&mdash;Gott!
Müller. I tell you, if we had done the Zeebrugge
attack ourselves, and I had been there, I would
feel that my honour and the Navy's honour was
safe, that we could stop and make peace. I
would be proud to die on such a service, and I
envy the Englishmen we buried when it was
over."</p>

<p>"But this is&mdash;Herr Capitan, you talk as if you
were an Englander&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Captain whirled on him, his eyes sparkling
dangerously. "<i>Dummkopf!</i>" he said. "Report
me if you like. I hate the English and I love
my Fatherland, but report me if you like. Ach!
You may report me in Hell, too; for I know&mdash;I
know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly and tilted back his
head to listen. The First Lieutenant shrank
back from him, his mouth open and his hands
feeling for the periscope support. A faint
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
murmur of sound came down wind from the
fleecy cloud-banks to the west. The Captain
jumped to the opening of the conning-tower
and stood, impatient and anxious by the lip,
until his lieutenant had slipped and scrambled
half-way down the ladder.</p>

<p>Then he jumped down himself, pulling the
lid to after him. Simultaneously there came
a rush and roar of air from venting tanks,
the stem of the boat rose very slightly as her
bow-gun went under, and in twenty seconds
the submarine was gone, and the bubbles and
foam of her passage were fading into the
level blue of the empty sea. A minute later
she showed a foot of periscope a cable's length
away, and a small airship topped the western
horizon and came slowly along towards her.
The periscope vanished again, and forty feet
below the surface the captain watched a gauge
needle beside the periscope creep round its
dial inch by inch till it quivered and steadied
at the forty-metre mark.</p>

<p>"Diving hands only. Fall out the rest.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Remain near your stations. Lower the periscope."
The First Lieutenant barked out a
repetition of each order as the Captain spoke.
There was a shuffling of feet, some guttural
conversation that spoke of a flicker of curiosity
among the men of the crew, and then all was
quiet but for the hum of motors and the
occasional rattle of gearing as the hydroplane
wheels were moved. The Captain moved
forward to the wardroom, removing his scarf
and heavy pilot-cloth coat as he walked.
"Order some food, Müller," he said. "I'm
hungry&mdash;that airship was farther ahead of
them than usual." He threw himself down
in a long folding-chair and stretched out his
sea-booted legs. "I won't come up to look
now until I hear them. Relieve the listeners
every half-hour, Müller. I want to have good
warning. We should hear a big convoy like
this at twenty miles to-day." The curtain rings
clashed and a seaman spoke excitedly
as he entered. The Captain nodded and
reached out to the table for his coffee-cup.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
"Just the bearing we expected," he said, "but
if they sound as faint as he says there's time
to get something to eat first."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>It was a big new standard ship which drew
the unlucky card in the game of "browning
shots." The torpedo hit her well forward,
its tell-tale track being unperceived in the
slight running swell until too late. A big
bubble of water rose abreast the break of the
forecastle till it reached deck-level, then it
broke and flung a column of spray, black
smoke, and fragments skyward. As the ship
cleared the smoke-haze, she was obviously
down by the head and steering wildly. Two
auxiliary patrol vessels closed on her at full
speed, and the nearest freighter increased speed
and cut in ahead of her in readiness either
to tow or screen. The torpedoed ship, after
yawing vaguely for a few minutes, steadied
back to the convoy's course, slowing her
engines till she only just retained steerage
way. There was a rapid exchange of signals
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
between her and the escort vessels, and then
an R.N. Commander on an adjacent bridge
gave a sigh of relief. "Good man that," he
said. "We'll have him in dry dock to-morrow.
It hasn't flurried him a bit, and I like his
nerve."</p>

<p>The explosion had caused more than the
salvage vessels to leap into activity. The
white track of the torpedo showed clearly
after it had gone home, and the first to take
action was a tramp, across whose bows the
track passed. The tramp was a ship of the
early 'nineties, and her full speed was at the
most nine knots, but her skipper at once
jammed her helm hard over to steer along
the torpedo-wake with a somewhat optimistic
hope of ramming. Two destroyers and an
armed auxiliary did the same thing, with the
result that the tramp skipper found himself
suddenly in the cross-wash of the warships
as they passed him at a few yards' distance
at twenty knots. Somebody on the bridge
of one of them screamed a profane warning
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
at him through a megaphone, and the skipper,
after a hurried glance at the quivering destroyers'
sterns, jumped to the telegraph and
stopped his engines. A couple of seconds
later his ship shook to a great detonation, and
a mighty column of water rose and broke
close ahead of him. He starboarded his helm
and swung round after the rest of the convoy,
his ship shaking to successive explosions as
more escorting vessels arrived at the spot
where he had turned.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>As his torpedoes left the tubes the U-boat
captain barked out an order. The attack had
been fairly simple, but his hardest problem
was only beginning. The boat's bow dipped
sharply in answer to the tilted hydroplanes,
and she began her long slide down to the two-hundred-foot
mark. She had got to fifty
before a sound like a great hammer striking
the hull told them of a successful torpedo-run.
The Captain looked up from his watch and
smiled. A moment later he was watching
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the gauges with a grave and impassive face.
He knew that the fact of his torpedo hitting
would mean greater difficulty for him in the
next few hours than he would have known
had he missed altogether. At a hundred feet
the first depth-charge exploded, smashing
gauge-glasses, electric lamps, and throwing a
couple of men off their feet. The boat rocked
and rolled under the shock, while orders were
roared through voice-pipes for more emergency
lights to be switched on. More charges exploded
as the boat slid downwards, but each
charge was farther away than the last. The
half-light of the hand-lamps round the periscope
showed the source of a sound of pouring
waters&mdash;two rivets had been blown right out
of the inner hull close before the conning-tower.
The Captain shouted orders, and the submarine
levelled off her angle and checked at the fifty-metre
line, while two men began frantically
to break away the woodwork which stretched
overhead and prevented the rivet-holes being
plugged. At that depth the water poured in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
through the holes in solid bars, hitting the
deck, bouncing back and spreading everywhere
in a heavy spray which drenched circuits and
wires.</p>

<p>"Müller! where the devil are you? Start the
pumps&mdash;I can't help it if they hear us. Start
the pumps, fool!"</p>

<p>"But you will come up? You will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Schweinhund! Gehorsamkeit!</i> Go!"</p>

<p>The pumps began to stamp and clatter as
they drove the entering water out again, but
above the noise of the pumps the Captain could
hear the roaring note of propellers rushing far
overhead. If it had not been for those infernal
rivets, he thought, he would have been at three
hundred feet by now, but he could not risk the
extra wetting which a pressure of a hundred
and thirty pounds to the inch on the entering
water would give to his circuits. The weight
of extra water in the bilges was nothing&mdash;he
could deal with that&mdash;though the thought of
the six hundred odd fathoms of water between
him and the bottom was a thing to remember
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
anxiously in case of his getting negative buoyancy;
but if this continual spray of salt water
reached his motor circuits it would be fatal.
He cursed the men who were vainly trying to
block the rivet-holes with wood wedges, and
jumping on the periscope table he tried to guide
the end of a short plank&mdash;intended as a baffle-plate&mdash;across
the stream. As he stood working,
a terrific concussion shook the U-boat from stem
to stern. The bows rose till men began to slip
aft down the wet deck, and from aft came a
succession of cries and shouted orders, "Close all
doors! the after-hatch is falling in&mdash;Come up
and surrender&mdash;Lass uns heraus!" The Captain
rose from the deck beneath the eye-piece, shaky
from his fall from the table. He hardly dared
look at the gauge, but he kept his head and
his wits as he gave his orders. With the
motors roaring round at their utmost power
and an angle up by the bow of some fifteen
degrees, the U-boat held her own, and as tank
after tank was blown empty, she slowly gained
on the depth gauge and began to climb. As
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
she rose, she was shaken again and again by
the powerful depth-charges that were being
dropped on the broken water left by the air-bubble
from her after compartment&mdash;a surface-mark
now a quarter of a mile astern.</p>

<p>Beneath the conning-tower more and more
men were gathering, some calm, some white,
trembling, and voluble. The boat broke surface
with her stem and half her conning-tower showing,
then levelled a little and tore along with
the waves foaming round her conning-tower
and bridge. From inside they could clearly
hear the shells that greeted her, and in a
moment there was a rush of men up the ladder.
Among the first few the Captain saw his First
Lieutenant's legs vanish upwards, and at the
sight a sneering smile showed on his sunburnt
face. The first man to open the lid died as he
did so, for a four-inch shell removed the top of
the conning-tower before he was clear of it.
The escort was taking no chances as to whether
the boat's appearance on the surface was intentional
or accidental, and they were making
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the water for a hundred yards around her
fairly boil with bursting shell. As the boat
tore ahead, holding herself up on her angle and
her speed, a few men struggled out of her one
by one past the torn body of the first man to
get out. Two of them leaped instantly overboard,
but the next clawed his way up to a
rail, and while others scrambled and fought
their way overside, and shells crashed and
burst below and around him on water and
conning-tower casing, he stood upright a moment
with arms raised high above his head. At the
signal the firing ceased as if a switch had been
turned by a single hand, and he subsided in a
huddled heap on the bridge as the riddled submarine
ran under. Down below the Captain
still smiled, leaning with his elbows on the
periscope training-handles and watching the
hurrying men at the ladder's foot, until the
great rush of water and men, that showed that
the end had come, swept him aft and away
across the border-line of sleep.</p>

<h2>THROUGH AN ADMIRALTY<br />
WINDOW.</h2>

<p>The room was exactly the same as any room
in any Government building, except that the
Naval observer would have at once noticed one
fact&mdash;that the furniture was of the unchanging
Admiralty pattern. The roll-top desk, the
chairs, and even the lamp-shades, would have
been to him familiar friends. They were
certainly familiar to the Post-Captain who sat
at the desk. Captain Henry Ranson had been
a noted Commander before his retirement&mdash;a
man of whom many tales, both true and
apocryphal, still circulated when Senior Officers
of the Fleet forgathered at the lunch intervals
of Courts-Martial and Inquiries. He had little
opportunity in his present War appointment to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
display any of the characteristics on which his
Sagas had been based, for neither seamanship,
daring, or, well&mdash;Independent Initiative, were
quite in keeping with the routine of an
Admiralty Office.</p>

<p>To-day he was feeling the claustrophobia of
London more acutely than usual. The sun was
shining through the big window across the
room, and he wanted to rise and look out at
the blue sky and white cloud-tufts that he
knew to be showing over the buildings across
the Horse Guards Parade. His desk gave him
no view through the window&mdash;he knew the
weakness of his powers of concentration on his
eternal paper work too well to have allowed
himself such a distraction; but as the door
opened to admit his clerk&mdash;a firm and earnest
civilian with the zeal of monastic officialdom
shining through his spectacles&mdash;he rose
abruptly and moved out into the sunlight
glare.</p>

<p>"Yes, Collins? What is it?"</p>

<p>"A small matter, sir, which is not quite in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
order. If you will glance through this you
will no doubt agree with me."</p>

<p>The Captain took the sheets from the clerk's
outstretched hand and moved a little away from
the glaring light to read.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honour to bring to your
notice the conduct of Skipper A. P. Marsh, of
the Admiralty tug <i>Annie Laurie</i>, on the 22nd-23rd
November 1917, and I beg to recommend
him for decoration in view of the following
facts:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>On November 21st, 1917, the steamer
<i>Makalaka</i>, homeward bound with corn, was
shelled by a U-boat when near the Irish coast.
The enemy was dealt with by a patrol in the
vicinity, but the <i>Makalaka</i>, proceeding east at
full speed in accordance with instructions, was
thrown out of her reckoning by a damaged
compass, and found herself at dusk on a lee
shore off the Galway coast, with her shaft
broken (a result of shell damage which had not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
been realised to be serious at the time it was
incurred). Skipper Marsh, seeing her flares
from his patrol to seaward, most gallantly closed
her and took her in tow in a rising N.W. gale.
In view of the probability of the attempt to
tow failing, the crew of the <i>Makalaka</i> were
taken aboard the tug, but the towing was continued
through a full gale lasting twenty-four
hours until the ship was out of danger.&mdash;I
have the honour to be, sir, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>The Post-Captain folded the letter carefully
and placed it on his desk. The clerk retrieved
it, and moved towards the door. The Captain
turned, "What are you going to do with that,
Collins?"</p>

<p>"I take it that it needs only the usual reply,
sir&mdash;that this is not approved&mdash;with a reference
to the regulation bearing on the case."</p>

<p>"Why not approved, Collins?"</p>

<p>The clerk was shocked, and his tone showed
it. "Because that decoration is for gallant
action in face of the enemy, and this case does
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
not come within its scope. In any case the
man will get salvage." [The Captain made an
impatient gesture.] "If the Royal Humane
Society care to&mdash;&mdash;" he stopped, because the
Captain had walked to the window, and, in
obvious inattention to the speaker, was staring
out across the wide Horse Guards and far
beyond the fleecy clouds that drifted across the
sky over the great sea of buildings that hemmed
him in.</p>

<p>Captain Ranson had gone on a journey&mdash;back
through forty years of time, and across eighty-one
degrees of longitude.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>He ran up the gangway, straightened his
helmet and dirk-belt, and approached the Commander,
who, a tall dark-featured figure, was
standing looking down on the boat as she rose
and fell alongside to the gentle heave of the
Indian Ocean&mdash;"Second cutter manned, sir."</p>

<p>The Commander turned and looked the boy
over beneath his heavy eyebrows. "When are
you going to set up a new port shroud?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
    The Midshipman fingered the seam of his
trousers, and looked carefully at the buttons on
the Commander's tunic&mdash;"I thought, sir, that is,
we've got a new shroud all fitted, but I thought&mdash;the
coxswain said, sir&mdash;that the old one would
do for to-day as the wind's nothing...."</p>

<p>The barometric indications of the Commander's
eyes showed threatening weather. He took the
boy's arm in the grasp of a heavy hand and
led him to the rail abreast the swinging mastheads
of the boat.</p>

<p>"Now listen, young gentleman," he said.
"What the coxswain said isn't evidence. It's
<i>you</i> that command that boat, and <i>you</i> that
will handle and command her. Don't talk to
me again as if you were a schoolboy." The
Midshipman shivered and squinted cautiously
up to see if the storm-signals were still in
evidence. The dark stern eyes were looking
down at him in a way that made him feel as
if he was some luckless worm that had unhappily
bored its way up into the publicity of
an aviary. The Commander moved his hand
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
and turned the boy to face him. "Now, you
remember this, young gentleman, only seamen
come through gales safely&mdash;it's the fools that
go to sea with rusty shrouds and weak rigging.
And if you're to be a seaman you must never
go to sea, even in a flat calm, unless your ship
is ready for a gale of wind. Do you understand
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then don't forget it, or I'll have you beaten
till you grow corns. Now shove off, and pull
away three cables on the port bow, drop your
anchor on the shoal, and fit that new shroud.
Remain there till the ship has got under way,
done her night-firing, and signalled you to carry
on. You will then close and weigh the target
moorings, having the target ready for hoisting
when the ship comes back to you. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What have you got on your anchor?"</p>

<p>"A hundred and twenty fathom, sir&mdash;of four-inch."
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
"That is enough&mdash;there is thirty fathom on
the shoal&mdash;Carry on!"</p>

<p>The Midshipman ran down the gangway, and,
jumping into the cutter, "Carried on." The
Commander was an officer of whom the boat-midshipmen
stood in awe, and they were
always thankful when the ordeal of reporting
a possibly unready boat to him as "ready"
was over.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The last shot kicked up a yellow fountain of
spray in the glare of the searchlight, and
ricochetted, humming, over the target and on
towards Malaya. A rocket sailed up from the
distant ship&mdash;the searchlight flickered out a
couple of Morse signs and went out, and in the
velvety darkness of a tropic night the hands
went forward in the cutter to weigh the anchor,
the process of "shortening-in" having been accomplished
a full hour ago. As the Midshipman
stood up to superintend the operation, he saw a
queer white line spreading and brightening along
the horizon to the westward. A dash of rain
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
struck his face, and a little gust of wind
moaned past him. The crew looked up from
their work to wonder, and in a matter of
seconds the squall was on them. The wet
hawser slipped and raced out, the hands jumping
aft to get clear of the leaping turns as the
cutter swung and drew hard on her anchor to
the pressure of a tremendous wind. The white
line rushed down on them, and showed as a
turmoil of frothing sea, beaten flat by the wind
into a sheet of phosphorescence veiled by low-flying
spray. For a few minutes they crouched
and endured the sudden cold and wet, then a
yaw of the boat sent the bowmen forward with
suspicion in their minds. "Up and down, sir&mdash;anchor's
aweigh," came the report, in a voice
that started as a roar, but reached the Midshipman
aft as a faint high wail. The Midshipman
faced round to leeward, and thought
hard. He had been anchored on the only
possible shoal, and once driven off that there
was no holding-ground till he should reach the
edge of the surf off Trincomalee, twenty miles
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
away&mdash;all between being chartered as "Five
hundred and no bottom." He called to the
coxswain and clawed his way forward, picking
up men by name as he passed them. They hove
up their anchor, secured mainsail, awning, and
mainmast in a dreadful tangle of rope and canvas
to the anchor-ring&mdash;hitched an outlying corner
of the tangle to a bight far up the hawser, and
threw all over the bows. The cutter steadied
head to wind, and the hands moved aft to raise
the bow and protect themselves against the
steady driving of the spray.</p>

<p>The Midshipman lay across the backboard,
staring out to the port-quarter. Through the
white haze he could see, at regular intervals, a
quick-flashing gleam of yellow light. He knew
what it was, and it did not comfort him. It was
all he could see of the twenty-thousand candlepower
of Foul Point Light, and although it was
not getting much clearer it was certainly "drawing"
from aft forward. He had the rough lie
of the coast in his head, and he was just realising
two things&mdash;first, that in spite of the sea
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
anchor he was being blown to leeward and
ashore at an incredible rate; and second, that
if he could not round Foul Point across the
wind, he was going to be food for the big surf-sharks
before the morning.</p>

<p>He roused the crew again, and set them to the
oars. Before half the oars were out he had
realised the futility of the effort, and was trying
to get them back without further damage. He
corrected his error with the loss of four oars
and several feet of the cutter's gunwale&mdash;broken
off when the wind tore the long ash oars away.
As he remembered later, it was at this point
that Foul Point Light began to show clearly
through the spray, and that his coxswain began
to sing an interminable hymn in the stern-sheets,
and that the dark-faced Celtic stroke-oar, a man
who had the reputation of being the worst
character in all the ship, took over the helpless
coxswain's duty. The Midshipman was
staring fascinated at the swinging beam of light
that was beating on them from the sand-spit
broad on the quarter, when the stroke-oar's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
voice in his ear changed him from a boy to an
officer&mdash;"What'll you do now, sir?"</p>

<p>The question was answered on the instant&mdash;"All
hands, up masts and sails. Close-reef both,
and pass the hawser aft. Lash out now, lads,
and get down to it."</p>

<p>That twenty-minute evolution, by the light of
a hurricane-lamp, was a nightmare. The mainsail
and mainmast were all snarled up in miscellaneous
turns of roping. The hawser was wet
and cold, and seemed fifty times its original
length, but the work was done. He had felt
that no shroud, however new, would stand the
strain he was going to put on the masts, and
though the men cursed and swore at the delay
and toil involved, he got what he wanted from
them. One at a time the masts were hove up
and clamped in position against the half-solid
wind&mdash;the hawser, cut to length, clove-hitched
round each masthead, and frapped clear round
the cutter, with the whole hove taut with
"Spanish Windlasses," till his clumsy hemp
shrouds were braced to the strain. Then he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
braced himself by a glance at the light, swinging
well over their heads now that they were
close enough in to feel the first lift and heave
of the outer surf, and yelled an order. The foresail
rose, clattered furiously a moment against
the mast, and then filled with a bang. "<i>Set
mainsail!</i>" The cutter heeled over till her lee
gunwale dipped&mdash;the masts bent and creaked,
and the old boat went tearing into the wind
on the best and last sail of her varied life. The
Midshipman and the stroke-oar clung to the long
tiller that was curved like a fishing-rod under
the strain. There were no gusts or variations
in the wind: it beat solidly against the canvas,
heeling the cutter to the verge of capsizing, and
driving her through the water at steamer speed.
The leeway was extraordinarily great&mdash;the boat
going sideways almost as fast as she went ahead;
but that leeway saved her from going over.
They cut through the outer surf off the point,
the boat leaking from the sprung keel to the
opened seams where the frapping hawser-turns
bit into her thin sides&mdash;the crew baling furiously
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
to keep their minds from the expectation of a
great crash that would tell of a mast tearing its
heel up and out through the weather side. It
lasted for barely half an hour, but the arm-weary
Midshipman felt as if it had been a four-hour
watch. As the light drew aft, he eased his sheets
and swung up the channel, still at racing speed,
but safely bound for harbour. His memories in
after years of the next few hours were vague
and clouded by sleep. He remembered the sun
rising as they drew in towards the silent white-walled
dockyard; the <i>swish</i> of sand under the
keel as he ran her hard up the boat-camber
beach, and nothing more, till he woke to see the
dreaded Commander&mdash;a tall white-clad figure&mdash;standing
over him, looking with keen appraising
eyes at the mass of hawser-turns that swathed
boat and masts, and at the bodies of the snoring
crew that lay on the hot sand around her.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The Clerk fidgeted. He had been kept waiting
for a matter of seconds, and he did not like it.
The Captain turned to face him, and, to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
surprised eyes of the Clerk, seemed to have
changed suddenly into a young man&mdash;alert,
quick, and decisive. "<i>No</i>, Collins," said a
strange voice; "the man <i>did</i> act in the face
of the enemy, and I will endorse the recommendation."
He turned his eyes again to the
window, but saw only the yellow gravel, the
houses, and the smoke; the fetters of Routine
seemed to clank warningly in his ears. "Yes,"
he said, "I have no reason to suppose the U-boat
had not followed the steamer, or that she was
not present all the time."</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>
<h2>A MOST UNTRUE STORY.</h2>

<p>The War was only in its first childhood and
patrol work was still amusing, having not yet
become a monotonous and unexciting business.
The submarine was due to start back from
patrol that night, and was just loafing along
at twenty odd feet depth waiting for dark.
The Captain was on watch at the periscope,
swinging the instrument round from time to
time to take a general survey of the horizon,
but for the most part confining his scrutiny to
the island to leeward. The island showed up
clearly&mdash;the light of the setting sun flashing
back from the windows of the buildings that
looked out over the Bight. As the Captain
took one of his all-round glances, he checked
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
suddenly and concentrated his gaze to one point
of the compass. A man who leaned against a
pump six feet away&mdash;a man who had seemed
to all appearance to be on the verge of sleep&mdash;opened
his eyes, straightened up, and stood
alertly watching the brown hands that held the
periscope training handles. The signal seemed
to be telepathically passed on, as in a few
seconds there were six or eight pairs of eyes
watching the observer, who still peered at the
unknown sight which no one else in the boat
could see. Then the Captain moved his head
back from the eye-piece, smiled (and at the
smile six of the watchers reverted to their oil-stained
reading matter), and called to the First-Lieutenant,
who was at the moment engaged
with an Engine-room Artificer in a mumbled
inquest over a broken air-valve spindle. As the
First-Lieutenant approached, the Captain stepped
to one side and indicated the eye-piece by a
nod. His subordinate took his place, and for
a full half-minute remained slowly swivelling
the great instrument through four points and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
back again. When he raised his head he was
scowling and sullen.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the Captain. "A good few
there, eh?"</p>

<p>"<i>Lord!</i>" The First-Lieutenant's voice indicated
the deepest disgust. "Thousands and
thousands&mdash;and we can't get a shot at 'em!"</p>

<p>"Well, there's over a thousand, anyway. I've
seen at least that lot of teal in the last couple
of minutes."</p>

<p>"<i>Teal!</i> Why, sir, I can see mallard now for
the next half mile, and I could swear there'll be
geese among them too."</p>

<p>"Here, let me look. Yes, by gum, and not
one's getting up either." They let the periscope
get to a few feet off before they paddle away....
He swivelled slowly round the circle,
then looked up at the First-Lieutenant.
"There's fog coming on. I can see the banks
coming," he said. He looked again through the
periscope and intently studied the windows on
the island some three miles away. The First-Lieutenant
watched his face, and saw it slowly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
break into the smile of a schoolboy meditating
mischief. The First-Lieutenant began to smile
slightly also. The Captain looked up.</p>

<p>"I can't help the island," he said. "War's
hell, anyway. Give me a rifle and stand by for
surface." There was a clatter and the sound of
quick-passing orders; the boat's bow tilted up,
and to the sound of roaring air she broke surface
fairly in the middle of the great colony of
swimming wildfowl. The hatch fell back with
a clang, and a rush of cold air beat on the
excited faces of the men below the conning-tower.
Immediately there came the <i>Crack-crack-'rack</i>
of magazine-fire from the bridge
above, and the descendants of bowmen who had
risked mutilation and death to steal the Conqueror's
deer forgot their discipline and began
to mount the ladder that led to the sunlight
and a clear view.</p>

<p>The Captain turned to shout a helm order
below and swore at the packed heads that
filled the hatch-rim. "... and you come up,
Number One, and lend a hand to pick up. I've
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
got one&mdash;missed him on the water at a hundred
and got him in the air as he rose! There he
is&mdash;jump forr'd and grab him&mdash;dammit, he's
off (<i>crack-crack</i>).... No, that's stopped him"
(<i>bang</i>&mdash;the report came from the vicinity of
the Captain's knee). "What the&mdash;confound
you, man&mdash;what the deuce are you doing? Unload
that pistol and take it away...."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Seven thousand yards away on the island a
watcher lowered his glasses and reached for
the button of the alarm bell. In two seconds
the island was awake, and down in the lower
battery men rushed to their stations. With
clatter and turmoil the big guns were cleared
away and the observing officer roared the order
to "Stand by" into the telephone mouthpiece.</p>

<p>"What is it, Schultz? Can you see? Ach!
she is going to bombard&mdash;the little swine of a
boat. Give me the telescope. Ach, Gott! are
they not reported ready, fool?" The Major
was excited and bristling.</p>

<p>"Ready now&mdash;all but number six."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
    "At six thousand five hundred metres&mdash;all
guns&mdash;Gott strafe der schmutzige ... he has
dived!..."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The First-Lieutenant sprang up the outer
ladder of the conning-tower, the bleeding spoil
clutched in his hand. The Captain turned to
look astern and became aware of the fact that
the gallery, as represented by the bridge and
rails, was tenanted by an enthusiastic and interested
selection of his crew. "What the devil&mdash;is
this a cinema or my ship? Don't you
know your orders yet? Every man-jack of
you...." He herded them below to the tune
of a voluble hymn of hate, and followed the
last of the grinning culprits down. As the
boat levelled off at her previous diving depth,
he swung the periscope round to search the
horizon again to seaward. A moment later
"Diving stations," and to the hydroplane men,
"Take her on down."</p>

<p>The First-Lieutenant left the luckless mallard
on the table and elbowed his way aft again
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
through the cluster of men closing up to their
stations. Reaching the control position, he
looked inquiringly at the Captain, who, having
lowered the periscope, was leaning with folded
arms against a group of valves abreast it.</p>

<p>"Thick fog coming down. Going to bottom
till dark now. Have a look at the soundings,
will you&mdash;or tell Henley to let me know."</p>

<p>The First-Lieutenant moved back to speak
to another officer, who was already bending
over the chart-table. The Captain turned his
head to watch the gauge beside him, the needle
of which was slowly creeping upwards and
around the circle. As it moved the gentle
rolling of the boat that had been noticeable before
ceased, and she steadied until she gave the
idea of being high and dry in some silent dock.
The officer, generally known as "Pilot," or&mdash;to
his intimates and contemporaries&mdash;as "Rasputin"
(a name, it should be explained, which had no
possible application to him, except for the fact
that he wore a beard), appeared at the Captain's
side with a folded chart in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
    "We should touch at ninety by the gauge,
sir," he said. "We must be about four miles
from the land now."</p>

<p>The Captain nodded. "Yes, it may be a
little more, though. Have the crew got a sweep
on this?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. This is an extra dive, and they
haven't had time to get one up. D'you want
to bet on under or over ninety, sir?"</p>

<p>"I do not. I won last night's sweep, and
lost it to you in side-bets, and I'm not taking
any more. Stop the motors!"</p>

<p>The gauge had reached the eighty-foot mark,
and the boat under the influence of her headway
was still driving the needle slowly round.
At ninety feet the Captain looked at the Pilot,
smiled, and started the motors again. Hardly
had he given the order when the needle checked,
rose a little, and then crept back to ninety-five.
"<i>Stop the motors!</i> I've lost a chance there,
Pilot&mdash;'Wish I'd had a bet on that."</p>

<p>He stood watching the gauge a moment longer,
and then turned to walk to the Wardroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
    "Pipe down&mdash;usual sentries only," he ordered.
"Tell my servant to get me some washing
water."</p>

<p>He threw the curtain aside, and joined the
two officers who stood looking solemnly at the
mallard, which lay on a gory newspaper in
the centre of the table. For a moment there
was silence.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Captain cheerfully, "it's not
as smashed as it might be. It'll do for a pie
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"'Mm," said the First-Lieutenant, "'Keeper at
home used to call rabbits that looked like that
'ferrets' food.'"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," rejoined the Captain; "if we
mash him in a pie he'll be all right."</p>

<p>There was another pause while the First-Lieutenant
tucked an extra fold of newspaper
beneath the corpse&mdash;then, after a quick glance
and nudge for the Pilot's benefit, he spoke in a
detached and dispassionate voice.</p>

<p>"Of course, it was poaching."</p>

<p>The Captain's brown face began to slowly take
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
on the colour of the gore on the table&mdash;then he
exploded&mdash;</p>

<p>"What d'you mean? ... <i>poaching</i>&mdash;it's below
high-water mark, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir&mdash;we don't know the rules in this
country, and we were pretty well in their
waters."</p>

<p>"But it's offshore. Why shouldn't I shoot their
duck? It's not preserved, either. <i>Poaching!</i>
I never poached anything&mdash;not since I was at
school anyway." He scowled at the duck and
the officers impartially. The officers clutched
each other by the arms, then the Pilot walked
hastily to a low-set bunk and buried his head
in the pillow. The Captain changed his frown
for a smile as the situation dawned on him, then,
snatching the parallel rulers from the chart-table
he began to belabour the most accessible portion
of his gurgling subordinate's anatomy.</p>
